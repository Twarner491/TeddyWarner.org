Following current population growth trends, the United Nation\u2019s Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) predicts a required 70% growth in food production by 2050 to adequately match global needs.<sup>1</sup> As of 2020, 9.9% of the present human population faced undernourishment with an estimated 720 and 811 million humans going hungry. Continued reliance on current insufficient North American Agriculture practices will bolster inadequate access to nutrition. Seedstock.com divides problems with contemporary agricultural practices into categories including \u2026</p> <ul> <li>Resource Depletion - The Costs of Industrial Agriculture</li> <li>Land Management - Degrading and Undervaluing Farmland</li> <li>Food Waste - Compromising Food Security</li> <li>Demographic Changes - A Disconnected Public</li> </ul> <p>Addressing the developing demand for food requires a direct confrontation with each of these four challenges and opens the door for sustainable alternatives to classic agricultural practices - massive potential for entrepreneurial pursuit. Aquaponics offers the potential to address the problems of contemporary agricultural practices whilst demonstrating scientific principles and modeling biological cycles for the education of a local community. \u201cAquaponics is a form of agriculture that combines raising fish in tanks (recirculating aquaculture) with soilless plant culture (hydroponics).

Each \u201cAquaponics Cell\u201d in Adaptable Aquaponics (I\u2019ll touch on the distinction of these mentioned modules later in this section) contains eight individual plant boxes, each with a volume over two times as great as the smaller plant box of my Assistive Aquaponics Fish Tank. These up-scaled cells have been altered to ensure proper water flow at a larger scale, and are linked in series via several pipes to a Biofilter housed on the \u201cAquaponics Rack\u201d. Unlike in a small-scale ecosystem such as my Assistive Aquaponics Fish Tank, a biofilter is an essential component of a large-scale aquaponics setup. The filter expands the surface area of your system, providing ample space for the nitrogen cycle to occur.</p> <p>Following the Assistive Aquaponics Fish Tank once more, Adaptable Aquaponics is a cross between a Nutrient Film &amp; Media Bed aquaponics system. As water is pumped into each plant box from the biofilter, it continuously flows along the sloping profile of the plant box\u2019s bed, passing through the plant roots, before exiting the plant box through a waterfall-esk exit slit &amp; draining into the fish tank below. Plant beds &amp; fish tanks are placed in an eight-to-one ratio in each \u201cAquaponics Cell\u201d, a stack in contrast to the small tank and one-to-one ratio of the Assistive Aquaponics Fish Tank. Opting for a larger fish tank increases the output efficiency of an aquaponics farm. Instead of being restrained to small-scale aquaculture (such as goldfish in my Assistive Aquaponics Fish Tank), hardier fish such as Tilapia &amp; Catfish can be farmed - making the food output of the farms even more efficient. Water is pumped out through a drain pipe at the bottom of each tank, flowing through a sediment tank located on the \u201cAquaponics Rack\u201d before into the water pump &amp; then back into the biofilter. Parraling the system\u2019s inclusion of a larger tank for larger fish, a sediment tank is a must to free the system of excessive fish waste, allowing for maintained water clarity. Heavy waste carried in by the stream of water in the system will sink to the bottom of the sediment tank under conditions of low flow.</p> <p>The principle behind my design work on Adaptable Aquaponics parallels the \u201ccircles of progress\u201d model, where you begin by achieving the core minimum viable product, and expanding the diameter of your \u201ccircle\u201d, inflating your project with more layers of progress. Though this isn\u2019t my suggested approach to CAD, I found using the \u201ccircles of progress\u201d mindset useful while thinking of the modularity scales in my file.</p> Aquaponics Cell Adaptable Aquaponics System <p>Adaptable Aquaponics is constructed with layered modularity, a distinction highlighted by the component layering in my Fusion browser. </p> <p></p> <p>Eight Individual plant boxes make up a single aquaponics cell, two aquaponics cells make up a single aquaponics rack, and two aquaponics racks are housed inside of a single shipping container. The scaling of modularity allows for application scaling to be applied to Adaptable Aquaponics. A single plant box could be used in the form factor of my Assistive Aquaponics Fish Tank, or multiple Adaptable Aquaponic Shipping Containers could be housed in parallel to allow for large-scale farming. Modularity in the case of Adaptable Aquaponics not only enables future iteration &amp; reconfiguration but also the scaling of the ecosystem itself - meeting the needs of any potential consumers - ranging from individual to community.</p>"},{"location":"Projects/AdaptableAquaponics/#computational-design","title":"Computational Design","text":"<p>Shifting to an analysis of the CAD work behind Adaptable Aquaponics, I was super stoked to get to experiment with Fusion 360\u2019s new Automated Modeling tool!

I began the computational design work of my aquaponics rack outside of the automated modeling tool itself, but instead by creating both the top and bottom plates of my Aquaponics rack &amp; attaching 6 mounting points to each sheet. Then, working around the prepositioned Aquaponics Cells, biofilter &amp; sediment tank, I created shelves to hold the content of the racks, unattached to support. I then opened the automated modeling tool and selected the previously created mounting points on both the top and bottom plates as well as each shelf with the Faces to Connect selection tool. Note, that there are three individual vertical supports on each Aquaponics rack, so I selected a corresponding set of 1/3 of the total created faces for each automated operation. I moved on to the Bodies to Avoid selection tool, highlighting the components of each Aquaponics Cell, the biofilter &amp; the sediment tank closest to the selected points of connection. I was careful here to only select crucial bodies to avoid, not all in the model - the fewer input selections, the faster computation time.

Due to my structured high school student schedule, I am usually not around to look after and take care of a garden, and thus, this want for fresh foods hasn\u2019t become a reality. My interest in my Fab Academy final project came from this interest in having a home garden that could morph to my tight high school schedule. I started brainstorming this concept and found many projects and articles that were helpful or influential to my idea, some of them being Gardening + Arduino, Garduino, DIY Home Assistant Garden Automation System, Raspberry Pi Powered IOT Garden, and the Advanced Irrigation System. Although looking at projects like these gave me some inspiration, I have many personal design factors that have also helped me form my idea. I started the Fab Academy course with the idea of an Automated Windowsill Garden for my final project, talked about on my Orginal Project Concept page, however as I began work through the class, I expanded on the idea. After talking with Professor Neil Gershenfeld about my Final Project concept in the Computer-Aided Design week lecture, I began to alter my idea from this windowsill box garden, into a garden in a different form factor. While discussing my windowsill box concept, Neil suggested some research into the world of \u2018ponics\u2019, the techniques of growing plantlife without soil, where plant roots are placed in a water-mineral solution and fed with liquid fertilizers. After some research, I found the practice of Aquaponics especially appealing to me. \u201cAquaponics is a system of producing food that combines aquaculture (raising fish, snails, or prawns) and hydroponics (growing plants in water). It can be an elegant closed system whereby the fish produce waste which, in turn, circulates to feed the plants which, in turn, purify the water for the next school of aquatic generations\u201d (The Evolution of \u201cPonics\u201d in Organic). The second thought that also leads me to this change was the form factor of the projects themselves. I attend Fab Academy classes on my Highschool campus after I finished my school day, and carrying in a windowsill box like a coffin to and from our lab every day would be impractical. With this form factor issue comes my third motivation for this change, my family may be moving houses in the upcoming months, and I would not want to build a windowsill box to fit a windowsill on a house that I may not even live in by the end of this course. With all of these thoughts in mind, I was still committed to the idea of a Garden in general, and settled on an aquaponic garden in a fish tank-like form factor, with the plants growing on top of the tank itself. This not only solves my transportation problem, but a fish tank-style aquaponic garden could be placed inside, and then be moved from house to house. </p>"},{"location":"Projects/AssistiveAquaponics/#reasearch-planning-sketches","title":"Reasearch, Planning &amp; Sketches","text":"<p>Before starting work on designing, manufacturing, and running an aquaponics system, I set off to learn about the practice of aquaponics more in-depth.

I jotted down this \u201cCircle\u201d concept in the diagram shown below, listing out each step taken in the system to return to the starting place.</p> <p> Aquaponics Circle Diagram - System of Recirulation </p> <p> Aquaponics System Diagram - A more Colorful System Depiction </p> <p>When in balance, six steps create a successful aquaponics ecosystem, where all parts of the system rely on the others, a process known as recirculation. The aquatic life of the tank contributes poop and waste food into the ecosystem, creating ammonia, a toxin for the fish, in the water in the process. This generated ammonia is then converted into helpful Nitrites, and eventually, Nitrates by bacteria in the system through a natural process called The Nitrification Cycle, after which, the system\u2019s plants absorb these Nitades as plant food, filtering the water in the process, and therefore the eliminating any harmful ammonia in the system\u2019s water, returning the system to its starting place. The six major players in the system, Fish, Plants, Bacteria, Ammonia, Nitrites, and Nitrates, rotate around this six-step ecosystem repeatedly, and when kept intolerance with each other, create the thriving aquaponics ecosystem I\u2019m looking for in creating my aquaponics fish tank. In The Effectiveness of Aquaponic Compared to Modified Conventional Aquaculture for Improved of Ammonia, Nitrite, and Nitrate, an academy journal article written by Deswati, Amelliza Deviona, Ella Intan Sari, Yulizar Yusuf, and Hilfi Pardi for the Rasayan Journal of Chemistry, elements of the aquaponic system are analyzed, and some ideal thresholds are given for a balanced system between Fish, Plants, Bacteria, Ammonia, Nitrites, and Nitrates, all with included real-life large scale aquaponics systems. I found this journal super helpful with providing application to aquaponics and also expanding my understanding of the ecosystem components through the journal\u2019s experiments.</p> <p>Deswati, et al. \u201cThe Effectiveness of Aquaponic Compared to Modified Conventional Aquaculture for Improved of Ammonia, Nitrite, and Nitrate.\u201d Rasayan Journal of Chemistry, vol. 13, no. 1, Jan. 2020, p. 1.

Throughout the schematic creating process, I referenced a prior Fab Academy final project, the Sashakit \u201can Arduino compatible, fabbable board, and also an improved version of Fabkit.\u201d (Quote from the Sashakit, as well as one of my professors, Dr. Adam Harris, In-Circuit programmer board I made in my week 4 class. I found that looking at the labeled schematics and board designs for these boards give me the information I needed to dive deeper into the workings of a microcontroller. Before starting any work in Autodesk EAGLE, I took some time to write out my needs on a final project board and was able to use all of this pre-work to start creating my final project board schematic. I worked through this schematic system by system, adding components as I went until I had a finished schematic. I found this approach to be more assistive in my understandings of how the components interact with each other and also allowed me to do some additional research on the different needed sections while working on them. I finished all major sections of my schematic following this approach, and the only editing that I had to go in to add later were 0-ohm jumper resistors, a component I used to connect traces at intersections while designing my final project board.</p> <p></p> <p>With this schematic done, I moved onto generating my final board file, however, I wasn\u2019t entirely happy with the default generation for my final project board, as I wanted it to have a little more flair, so I set off to add a custom board shape, and some icons to my board design before routing any traces on the board. After doing some research on this process, I found this good article on Importing Custom Images into Eagle, a process easier said than done. Although this process of importing images and shapes into EAGLE is entirely possible, the software cannot handle the importing of any closed polygons or shapes with complex curves of any kind, and therefore any images/icons you want to be imported require a good bit of prep work. I completed this prep work in Inkscape on my desired board shape, a fishbowl, as well as on a little fish icon, and a TW logo for some more personalization. The prep work process for all these images was the same in Inkscape, starting with tracing the bitmaps into SVGs of these images after opening them in Inkscape. This step was to dive by right-clicking on the imported bitmap and selecting the Trace from Bitmap tool. This process generated a scalable vector graphic of the imported bitmap, that I could then start to alter so it could be imported into EAGLE. My workflow of altering this graphic started by resizing the Inkscape page by going to </p> <pre><code>File &gt; Document Properties\n</code></pre> <p>and selecting the Resize page to drawing or selection button under the Custom Size window. After this, I converted the graphic into a path by selecting Object to Path under the Path tab and the top of the Inkscape GUI, and ungrouped all parts of this path by selecting everything in the design, right-clicking, and then selecting Ungroup. Nextly, I navigated to </p> <pre><code>Extensions &gt; Modify Path\n</code></pre> <p>Where I used the Add Nodes tool to add excess nodes to my design. Under this same menu, I removed any complex curves that EAGLE would not be able to handle by using the Flatten Beziers tool with a flatness value of 8. Finally, to address EAGLE\u2019s inability to import closed polygons, I used the Division tool under the Path menu to cut any closed polygons in half, and then separated all of these nodes by using the Break Apart tool under the same menu. This process adds some unwanted dividing lines, that can be removed once imported into EAGLE, but these lines allow for the successful importing of these shapes in the first place, so are required. </p> <p> </p> <p>Once all this pre-work in Inkscape was complete, I saved each of these altered files as a .dxf file to my computer from Inkscape. To import these .dxf files into EAGLE, I found making use of the import-dxf plugin for EAGLE worked the best. After installing this ULP into EAGLE following the instructions provided by the import-dxf Github, I opened my final project generated board file in EAGLE and ran the command</p> <pre><code>run import-dxf\n</code></pre> <p>This line opens the import-dxf interface, where the desired .dxf file can be selected, and then imported into a specific layer of a board design. I imported my fishbowl .dxf into layer 20 of my design, the Dimensions layer, to replace the generic rectangle board profile, and then ran the same command to import both the fish icon, and the TW logo, but to the Top layer over the Dimensions. Because these shapes are on the Top layer of my board design, they will both be milled as traces instead of being included with the outline shape of the board. With all of this importing work done, I had a template to start routing the traces of my board around. I opted for the hand routing process for my final project board, as after attempting to autoroute a couple of times, I just wasn\u2019t happy with the results. This also gave me the ability to utilize parts like 0-ohm resistors as jumpers over weird interceptions of the board, a technique I took advantage of while routing the traces on this board. This hand routing process was relatively tedious and pretty time-consuming, but I think the results look great and work much better than the autorouter generated traces with the weird constraints put in place by the odd board shape. </p> <p> Final Project Board With All Trace Routed, and Icons Imported </p> <p>Unfortunately, this first iteration of my final project board didn\u2019t work on the first attempt, and I seemed to have an excess of noize across it, probably due to the large quantity of 0-ohm resistors in line with the traces. </p> <p>I kept iterating on this board, working towards the removal of the excess 0 ohms with better trace routing, an aspect of my board design that only improved over the iterations. On the sixth iteration of this board, shown in the schematic and board file images below, I had reduced the number of 0 ohms\u2019s on my board by a good bit, but also worked on the smoothing capacitors routing.</p> <p> </p> Sixth Itteration Fish Bowl Board Schematic <p> </p> Sixth Itteration Fish Bowl Board File <p>Just like its prior iterations though, this sixth iteration was still unsuccessful, and so far I had been unable to get a version working. I began to make some larger strides on this board during my week 13 class and started another iteration of this board by working back through all systems in the board\u2019s schematic, familiarizing myself with the purpose of each system/component. From here, I started work on adding in a 12v to 5v voltage regulator on the fishbowl board, as my fish tank will be run on a 12v DC supply, and this regulator will allow for this 12v system. I took advantage of a 12v to 5v voltage regulator in this regulator system, opposed to a variable voltage regulator, as the components on my fishbowl board will always be 5v, and thus the voltage can be set by the regulator itself. Along with this regulator, I included two 10uf capacitors between GND and VCC on the voltage regulators\u2019 input and output, reducing portion noise on my board.</p> <p> Seventh Itteration of the Fish Bowl Main Board Schematic </p> <p>With the addition of these new voltage regulator systems, a rewiring of the fishbowl board was needed, and during this time around, I took some extra time to reduce the needed components on the board, and allow for easier soldering. After messing around in the board file for a bit, I found I could use one of my \u201cFish Bowl\u201d shape decorative traces as a GND line that surrounded the entirety of my board. This line implemented a universal ground way more accessible from everywhere on the board and offered another solution to a problem I had previously addressed by using 0-ohm jumpers resistors to solve, routing GND lines over other traces with these \u201cjumpers\u201d. This surrounding ground line reduced the crazy amount of 0-ohm resistors on my board and made the board\u2019s soldering/stuffing process simpler and less time-consuming.</p> <p> Seventh First Itteration of the Fish Bowl Main Board  </p> <p>I milled this board following the same steps I used while milling boards previously in week 4, and other electronics production assignments in my previous weeks, starting with the board traces operation with a PCB engraving bit. While iterating on this board since week 6, I\u2019ve milled a handful of tests, some yielding successes in some systems, but always including another issue/broken system to flatten out. I next moved on to milling the board\u2019s holes and outline, using a 1/32\u201d bit for these two operations, before moving onto board soldering. </p> <p>The part reduction steps I had taken earlier while encluding the wrap-around GND trace on my board paid off here, and the boards soldering and stuffing time had been greatly reduced. One thing that I\u2019ve picked up on while soldering prior test fishbowl boards is a \u201cdrag\u201d technique while soldering the ATMega to the board. I used this technique on these boards as well, first aligning the chip to its corresponding pins (ensuring correct orientation), before tacking down one of the pins of the chip to the board, and then dragging the tinned iron across one of the rows of pads, allowing solder to flow and connect between each of the chips pins and the board\u2019s pads, and leaving me with a clean set of joints. With the chip soldered, I wrapped up the board by soldering all of the other components, finishing with the three largest components, the crystal, voltage regulator, and reset button, leaving me with the boards show below.</p> <p> Seventh Itteration of the Fish Bowl Main Board Stuffed &amp; Soldered </p> <p>As the first test for this new fishbowl board, after soldering, I hooked up the board to a 12v DC power supply, and then probed the new voltage regulator output to test the output voltage. To my luck, the regulator yielded a 5v output and remained at a constant voltage throughout my probing. I next moved onto attempting to burn a bootloader to the fishbowl board. This process is similar to the one taken while burning the bootloader on my Sashakit made in our Student Bootcamp class. The bootloader is burned to my board through an Arduino acting as an ISP programmer, so the first step while attempting to burn the bootloader was to set up the Arduino. I uploaded the Arduino example skets, Arduino as ISP, to an Arduino board, and referencing the Arduino as ISP sketch, and my fishbowl board eagle file, I attached the two with some jumpers using the pins called on by the Arduino as ISP sketch. From here, I opened the Arduino IDE, selected the port my Arduino acting as a programmer was connected to, and then used the IDE\u2019s Burn Bootloader tool, and \u2026 it failed. Unfortunately, even after triple-checking my wiring, switching my Arduino board, reuploading the Arduino as an ISP sketch, and ensuring my fishbowl board was receiving enough power from my power supply, I still received an error message upon any attempt to burn a bootloader. I tried this process a couple of times and received two different error codes, one of which is shown below.</p> <p> One Error Message Recieved Upon a Bootloader Burning Attempt </p> <p>A bit of research into the codes I was receiving helped me break down the problem a little bit, but not a ton. I found that there were three major potential flaws, however, a board short / VCC error, a \u201cbricked\u201d chip, or a non-oscillating clock, and decided to look into these three more. Being the easiest resolved I began looking into the VCC error a little more, starting by probing each of my board\u2019s traces for continuity between places that should not be connected, and also probed the voltages of the GND and VCC line of the board when supplied power, however, all of these results looked normal. After a little more research of the matter online, as well as into the ATMega 328p, I noticed that it recommended to included a smoothing 100nf capacitor in between the chips AREF line and its nearest GND pin, so back in the board\u2019s eagle file, I added this smoothing capacitor along with the previously existing 100nf smoothing capacitor running between two GND and VCC pins on my chip.</p> <p> Eight Itteration of the Fish Bowl Main Board With Smoothing Cap </p> <p>From here, I also explored the other two potential causes of my bootloader burning issue, however, I found no easy fix to a \u201cbricked\u201d chip, and therefore moved on researching a non-oscillating clock a little more. I found that similar to the \u201cbricked\u201d chip, a non-oscillating clock is not easily fixed, but can be avoided, as the clock will not turn to its non-oscillating state unless the fuses of the ISP programmer are incorrectly set. Confirming in my ISP programmer, I had the correct fuses set, and eliminated this as being one of my potential issues.</p> <p>As a workaround to my inability to \u201cUn-Brick\u201d a chip, I followed the advice of one of my instructors, Dr. Adam Harris, to test the working of my chip before using it aboard. To do this, I soldered up a Sashakit board, just like I had in my Student Bootcamp class, however, I left the chip unsoldered to this board. I was then able to connect this Sashakit board to an ArduinoISP programmer, and then use it to try out the bootloader on multiple chips. I aligned a chip with its corresponding pads of the sashakit, heald it down in the center with a pair of tweezers, and used the Arduino IDE to burn a bootloader to my board. All this worked! and the Arduino let me burn a bootloader to a couple of different chips, however, I did find some other faulty \u201cBricked\u201d chips along the way. Despite that, I was left with a couple of chips with bootloaders burned, that I could be sure were working, and was able to eliminate another potential issue on my board.</p> <p> Sashakit ATMega 328p Bootloader Burning Setup </p> <p>With all this troubleshooting into my issues at a stopping point, I was ready to manufacture another board iteration, going first milling the PCB, </p> <p></p> <p>then soldering and stuffing, leaving me with the board shown below.</p> <p></p> <p>Due to my previous failures with this board, I was pretty nervous to test this iteration and started my first just powering up the board through a power supply. Unfortunately, this simple startup produced a cloud of smoke from the top of my board, and the board\u2019s voltage regulator exploded. This error sucked, and ended up stemming from the misplacement of a strip of 5v to 3.3v regulators in a bin meant for 12v to 5v (the ones needed by my board), and the false component use ended up frying one of my boot loaded chips. I unsoldered the remains of the busted voltage regulator, as well as the fired chip, and replaced them with working correct components. I tested the board with power again, this time fortunately without explosion, and was ready to attempt to program the board again. I wired the board to an Arduino with the Arduino as ISP sketch flashed to it, and tried to upload a blink code \u2026 no luck. Upon this uploading attempt, the uploading process began, and then returned error 0x0000000, a GND or Reset error.</p> <p>Here I went back to my schematic, and went through the system by system, and referencing the datasheets for major components. I wanted to make sure to include all recommended/required components for components on each of their pins. In addition to what I already had, this included adding a larger smoothing capacitor between GND and VCC, another capacitor between AREF and its closest GND pin, as well as an additional RST pin, without the 100nf inline capacitor. After a board works though with Dr. Adam Harris, I also moved these additional smoothing capacitors closer to my board\u2019s ATMega 328 to reduce any resistance build upon the traces. All of these changes left me with yet another board iteration, shown below.</p> <p></p> <p>Again, I worked through the manufacturing process for this board, first milling, and the soldering and stuffing of the board. All of these board iterations have sped up their production time, as I know have the component layout of the board memorized, and have increased my soldering speed with each iteration. </p> <p> Working Iterration of the ATMega 328 Fish Bowl Board </p> <p>Just like the prior iterations, I wired up this board to an Arduino with the Arduino as ISP example sketch flashed to it, and attempted a bootloader burn, this time, yielding successful results!! </p>"},{"location":"Projects/AssistiveAquaponics/#main-board-testing","title":"Main Board Testing","text":"<p>After all of the troubleshooting that went into my fishbowl board, it was super nice to finally have to worry about code.

Goldfish, the fish that will be using in my ecosystem, thrive at a neutral pH, something between 7 &amp; 8.</p> <p></p> <p>I settled on using an Atlas Scientific Gravity pH Probe in my tank. This sensor, in addition to coming from a reputable company, allows the probe to be underwater up to its connector indefinitely, an important aspect of any tank probe, as well as for a connection between the probe and its interfacing board constantly, without a need for the probe to be detached when not in use. Before beginning the work on my board to interface with this pH probe and board, I did a bit of research into the operating principle of the sensor, a subject well covered in the Probe\u2019s Datasheet, with some highlights covered below.</p> <p>\u201cA pH (potential of Hydrogen) probe measures the hydrogen ion activity in a liquid. At the tip of a pH probe is a glass membrane. This glass membrane permits hydrogen ions from the liquid being measured to defuse into the outer layer of the glass, while larger ions remain in the solution. The difference in the concentration of hydrogen ions (outside the probe vs. inside the probe) creates a VERY small current. This current is proportional to the concentration of hydrogen ions in the liquid being measured.\u201d (Probe Datasheet)</p> <p></p> <p>\u201cA pH electrode is a passive device that detects a current generated from hydrogen ion activity. This current (which can be positive or negative) is very weak and cannot be detected with a multimeter, or an analog to digital converter. This weak electrical signal can easily be disrupted and care should be taken to only use proper connectors and cables \u2026 The current that is generated from the hydrogen ion activity is the reciprocal of that activity and can be predicted using [the equation pictured below]\u201d (Probe Datasheet)</p> \\[E = E^0 + \\frac{RT}{F}\\ln(\\alpha_{H+}) = E^0 - \\frac{2.303RT}{F}pH\\] <ul> <li>Where R is the ideal gas constant</li> <li>T is the temperature in Kelvin</li> <li>F is the Faraday constant</li> </ul> <p></p> <p>To calibrate the pH probe to work against these voltage reading thresholds, a calibration is required. Included along with the Atlas Scientific pH probe I ordered were three packs of pH calibration liquids, a 4, 7, and 10 level liquid. The concept of the calibration reflects measurements of the probe at each of these points, and the probe can be calibrated by being placed in each one of these liquids and then set to the liquid\u2019s corresponding pH value, leaving a scale like that shown below.</p> <p></p> <p>To achieve probe calibration and eventual readings from the probe, I created a simple analog sensor interfacing board with an ATTiny 1614 microcontroller. This board includes data pins to connect to the pH probe board array, along with transmitting and receiving pins that will be used for the eventual calibration of the probe.</p> <p> ATTiny 1614 pH Probe Interfacing Board Eagle Files </p> <p>This board is designed to reflect the exact board footprint of the pH sensing board, as well as its electrical isolation board used between the connection. Speaking of which, this electrical isolation board is a pH probe board accessory from Atlas Scientific that connects between the Atlas Scientific pH board and my analog interfacing board, allowing for complete isolation of analog signal from the pH sensor board, and its conversion into a PWM signal. This isolation board removes the issue of false readings that could occur from excess current in the water released by my tank\u2019s pump and leaves me with accurate pH readings. After the completion of my analog interfacing board, I milled and stuffed the board with its four components, leaving me with the board shown below.</p> <p></p> <p>With this board manufactured and ready to program, I again referenced the pH Probe\u2019s Datasheet, to find the Atlas Scientific Gravity pH Library &amp; Sample Code. This library adds a ton of helpful calibration and probe reading functions to Arduino. I ended up modifying the pH calibration example sketch included in this library for my final pH reading sketch, due to the inclusion of the entire calibration via serial feature as well as integration with my electrical isolation board. After this calibration function, the pH itself is read, and then written to a string and printed to serial. In front of this pH value, the line 3pH = is printed, to interface with my tanks LCD parsing statements, a function of code discussed later on this page, leaving me with the pH reading and printing loop function below \u2026</p> <pre><code>void loop() {\n  if (Serial.available() &gt; 0) {                                                      \n    user_bytes_received = Serial.readBytesUntil(13, user_data, sizeof(user_data));   \n  }\n\n  if (user_bytes_received) {                                                      \n    parse_cmd(user_data);                                                          \n    user_bytes_received = 0;                                                        \n    memset(user_data, 0, sizeof(user_data));                                         \n  }\n\n  Serial.println(\"3pH = \" + String(pH.read_ph(), 2));                                                      \n  delay(20000);\n}\n</code></pre> <p>This loop with my pH reading string was then incorporated back into the other functions of my pH code, and I was left with the final code below.</p> <pre><code>#define USE_GRAV_ISOLATOR\n#ifdef USE_GRAV_ISOLATOR\n  #include \"ph_iso_grav.h\"       \n  Gravity_pH_Isolated pH = Gravity_pH_Isolated(10);         \n#else\n  #include \"ph_grav.h\"             \n  Gravity_pH pH = Gravity_pH(10);   \n#endif\n\nuint8_t user_bytes_received = 0;                \nconst uint8_t bufferlen = 32;                   \nchar user_data[bufferlen];                     \n\nvoid parse_cmd(char* string) {                   \n  strupr(string);                                \n  if (strcmp(string, \"CAL,7\") == 0) {       \n    pH.cal_mid();                                \n    Serial.println(\"MID CALIBRATED\");\n  }\n  else if (strcmp(string, \"CAL,4\") == 0) {            \n    pH.cal_low();                                \n    Serial.println(\"LOW CALIBRATED\");\n  }\n  else if (strcmp(string, \"CAL,10\") == 0) {      \n    pH.cal_high();                               \n    Serial.println(\"HIGH CALIBRATED\");\n  }\n  else if (strcmp(string, \"CAL,CLEAR\") == 0) { \n    pH.cal_clear();                              \n    Serial.println(\"CALIBRATION CLEARED\");\n  }\n}\n\nvoid setup() {\n  Serial.begin(9600);                            \n  delay(200);\n  Serial.println(F(\"Use commands \\\"CAL,7\\\", \\\"CAL,4\\\", and \\\"CAL,10\\\" to calibrate the circuit to those respective values\"));\n  Serial.println(F(\"Use command \\\"CAL,CLEAR\\\" to clear the calibration\"));\n  if (pH.begin()) {                                     \n    Serial.println(\"Loaded EEPROM\");\n  }\n}\n\nvoid loop() {\n  if (Serial.available() &gt; 0) {                                                      \n    user_bytes_received = Serial.readBytesUntil(13, user_data, sizeof(user_data));   \n  }\n\n  if (user_bytes_received) {                                                      \n    parse_cmd(user_data);                                                          \n    user_bytes_received = 0;                                                        \n    memset(user_data, 0, sizeof(user_data));                                         \n  }\n\n  Serial.println(\"3pH = \" + String(pH.read_ph(), 2));                                                      \n  delay(20000);\n}\n</code></pre> <p>I uploaded this code to my analog pH interfacing board, and connected the board\u2019s communication and power headers to their corresponding pins on an FTDI chip, and then via USB to my laptop. </p> <p> pH probe wired to all three pH interfacing boards </p> <p>Following the calibration steps discussed a bit above, I completed the pH probe\u2019s first calibration starting with the 7 mid calibration liquid.

For space reasons, this page just covers the highlights of the working temperature/humidity monitoring board, and the troubleshooting behind it can be read about on my week 11 inputs class page.</p> <p>I began this temperature monitoring board manufacturing process by reading up on the DHT11 temp and humidity sensor, finding this link on its set up with an Arduino helpful, giving me some useful wiring diagrams. I planned on using this DHT11 Temperature and Humidity sensor on my temp and humidity monitoring board, reading the sensor through an onboard ATtiny 412, and writing the read values to another microcontroller through RX and TX pins. I started in EAGLE, creating a small ATtiny 412 circuit, incorporating a DHT11 Temperature and Humidity sensor, as well as some headers for programming and communication. First, I started a new schematic for the board, keeping in mind the required components while adding them to the schematic. The DHT11 sensor is a four-pin sensor with a VCC, GND, and two data pins. In my case, I communicated with the sensor via one data pin, keeping in mind this pin not only needed to be connected to my ATtiny 412 but also ran to VCC with a 10k ohms resistor. Along with its connection to this sensor, my board\u2019s ATtiny 412 also runs to two separate headers, one for programming via the board\u2019s UPDI pin, and another supplying the board\u2019s power, and RX and TX pins, for future communication between boards. A final little touch to this schematic was a power indicating LED, and this left me with the schematic shown below.</p> <p></p> <p>The next step in this board design process was the conversion of my schematic into my temperature and humidity reading board. Keeping with the aquarium theme, I decided to shape this board like a fish, following the same steps I used creating a custom board shape in eagle during week 6. For this board outline, I used the same fish icon I had created in that week\u2019s assignment, importing the shape into the dimensions layer of my sensor board file to create the shape. From here I began the process of laying out the board\u2019s components, in eagle, starting with the mounting position of the DHT11 sensor and ATtiny 412, and positioning around those two components. One thing I had to keep in mind during this layout is the size of the DHT11, as its connection to my board using a 4 pin header, but the body of the sensor itself was much larger than this. I began by positioning the header where I thought the rest of the sensor would fit, and checked this positioning by drawing a square from the corner of the header, so its dimensions were the size of the DHT11. From here I laid out all other components on my board and routed the board\u2019s traces. Due to the small size of this board, the trace routing was a relatively simple task and left me with a nice-looking temperature and humidity monitoring fish board.</p> <p> Final Tempeture and Humitidy Monetering Fish Board </p> <p> Fish Tempature and Humidity Sensor Board </p> <p>Similarly to before starting my board\u2019s schematic, before programming the board, I read up on the DHT11 sensor, referencing the same site as before, found here. </p> <p>\u201cThe DHT11 detects water vapor by measuring the electrical resistance between two electrodes. The humidity sensing component is a moisture-holding substrate with electrodes applied to the surface. When water vapor is absorbed by the substrate, ions are released by the substrate which increases the conductivity between the electrodes. The change in resistance between the two electrodes is proportional to the relative humidity. Higher relative humidity decreases the resistance between the electrodes, while lower relative humidity increases the resistance between the electrodes. The DHT11 measures temperature with a surface mounted NTC temperature sensor (thermistor) built into the unit.\u201d (Circuit Basics)</p> <p>The sensor relies on the DHTLib Arduino library and can read the sensors data pin into a readable humidity and temperature output. The libraries follow the equation below to derive the relative humidity from the sensor.</p> \\[RH = (\\frac{\\rho_w}{\\rho_s}) \\times 100\\%\\] <p>Where: - \\(RH\\): Relative Humidity - \\(\\rho_w\\): Density of water vapor - \\(\\rho_s\\): Density of water vapor at saturation</p> <p>With knowledge of the DHT11\u2019s workings, I began programming the code to read temp and humidity through the DHT11 and print the found values through TX to a serial monitor. I used the sensors reference code found on the Circuit Basics code as a reference and began the coding process. The code starts by including the needed DHTLib library and setting up the DHT11\u2019s connections to my boards ATtiny 412. Next, the code begins serial and then prints the found values to it, with the prefixes \u201cTemp\u201d &amp; \u201cHumidity\u201d in front of their corresponding values. This left me with the sensor reading code below.</p> <pre><code>#include &lt;Arduino.h&gt;\n#include &lt;dht.h&gt;\n\ndht DHT;\n\n#define DHT11_PIN 4\n\nvoid setup(){\n  Serial.begin(9600);\n}\n\nvoid loop(){\n  int chk = DHT.read11(DHT11_PIN);\n  Serial.print(\"Temp = \");\n  Serial.println(DHT.temperature);\n  Serial.print(\"Humidity = \");\n  Serial.println(DHT.humidity);\n  delay(5000);\n}\n</code></pre> <p>At the end of this sensor reading loop, I included a 5-second delay, as the DHT11 can only be read every 2 seconds, so this gives the sensor plenty of wiggle room.</p> <p>With this code flattened out, I wired my fish sensor board to my in-circuit programmed, made in week 4\u2019s electronic production class, connecting my boards GND and VCC to the programmers corresponding pins, and my sensor boards UPDI to the UPDI pin of my in-circuit programmer. I followed the same programing steps I\u2019ve used for all of my other ATtiny 412 containing boards, like that in week 4, uploading my sensor reading code through my in-circuit programmer using the Arduino IDE\u2019s Upload Using Programmer tool. This code was uploaded successfully to my board, and I was ready to move on to testing and reading my sensor.</p> <p>I attached this fish board to an FDTI chip, RX to TX, TX to RX, and GND to GND, and then attempted to read the sensors values again, and this time, it worked! Every five seconds the serial monitor is updated with reading temperature and humidity values from my DHT11, and output the values in a serial monitor through serial, shown below. </p> <p></p> <p>The final step in this sensor board code was a little bit of alteration to the serial prints I did in my week 14 class. These alterations allow for the communication required to print the transmitted values to a specific line on my system\u2019s LCD, a feature discussed later on this page. Beginning this process, I had to figure out how to print a specific line of incoming serial to a controlled position on an LCD. After a bit of research online, It seemed like the best way about doing this would be to include an indicator between different lines being sent over serial, and then read that indicator to determine the position of the text in the interface. With this idea in mind, I altered my input board\u2019s code to include a 1 before the transmitted temperature line, and a 2 before the transmitted humidity.</p> <pre><code>//(c) Teddy Warner 28 May 2021\n\n//This work may be reproduced, modified, distributed, performed, and displayed \n//for any purpose, but must acknowledge the Assistive Aquaponics Fish Tank. \n//Copyright is retained and must be preserved.

Eventually, I stumbled on the C204C-FTW-LW65 from Focus LCDs, a vertical compact 20 x 4 LCD, that works great for my use case. I originally began work on my systems LCD during my week 13 output class, as mentioned above, and just like the previous temperature and humidity monitoring board, this page will just touch on the working highlights of this feature, and my week 13 page goes into more depth on the troubleshooting behind it.</p> <p>This LCD met all of my space and screen size requirements, and I began in Eagle creating a breakout board to the screen. This board will mount to the LCD, and break out the screen pins to the headers that will need to connect to a microcontroller. The premise of the breakout board was pretty simple, and I referenced the C204C-FTW-LW65\u2019s datasheet and attached the needed data lines from the LCD, DB4-DB7, to a set of breakout pins on the board. I next hooked up the LCD\u2019s VCC and GND, as well as its backlight VCC and GND, to their corresponding power headers on the board. A 330 ohms resistor is included on the LCD backlight\u2019s VCC line, to dim the light so the screen\u2019s content is readable. I found the 330 resistance value worked better than the standard 220 for my C204C-FTW-LW65 greyscale style screen and allowed for better readability. The final portion of this board was a contrast adjusting 10k ohms potentiometer. This potentiometer provides a voltage to the LCD\u2019s contrast adjusting pin, allowing the LCD character brightness to be altered, leaving me with the final schematic shown below.</p> <p></p> <p>With this schematic flatted out, I moved onto converting this schematic into my LCD breakout board. Here I began again by referencing the datasheet, positioning the LCD mounting headers to the correct dimensions on my board to line up with the C204C-FTW-LW65 LCD. From here, I positioned the contrast adjusting potentiometer to mount on the backside of the board, allowing the LCD to mount directly over the breakout board, in the most space-efficient manner. From here, I also positioned the board\u2019s resistor and jumper resistors, and then positioned the breakout headers towards the bottom of the board, before running all of the board\u2019s traces. Due to the mounting position of this breaker board, the shape had to fit in as compact of a space behind the LCD as possible, so I dragged the boards outline down to fit around the boards content, and used Eagles miter tool to round over the board\u2019s corners, leaving me with the boards shown below.</p> <p></p> <p>Due to its single 330 ohms resistor component and three-pin potentiometer, the milling and stuffing of this LCD breakout board weren\u2019t super time-consuming, and I worked through it with relative ease. I first attached the breakout board to the backside of the LCD board, soldering the pins of the LCD to their propper pads on the breakout board. From here I tracked down the 330 ohms resistor, and also soldered the potentiometer in place. Finally, I attached the breakout board headers, that would allow for connections between the LCD and the board, leaving me with the LCD and breakout system below.</p> <p> Compleated LCD and Breakout Board Assembly </p> <p>After the completion of my LCD breakout, I began the interface coding process in the second half of my week 13, and then later expanded on the interface in my week 14 networking and communication assignment. The LCD interface code utilizes the Liquid Crystal Library included by default in the Arduino library for LCD control. Breaking down the code, there are two sections of my LCD interface, a boot screen, and a status display screen that will in the future, provide information read from my Aquaponics fish tank\u2019s sensors. I started the interface work on my tank\u2019s boot screen. The boot screen code is a simple display of characters spanning the width of the LCD, with the top and bottom lines being filled with -, and the middle lines displaying the text Aquaponics Fish Tank and \u2026 In Development. The inclusion of this boot screen in the Void Setup function of my code shows this boot screen upon bootup of the system, and the function includes a short delay while displaying the screen, allowing all of the input sensors to get started up and begin future communications with the mainboard.</p> <p> Aquaponics Fish Tank LCD Bootscreen Code  </p> <p> Aquaponics Fish Tank LCD Bootscreen Implemented in Void Setup </p> <p>From this boot screen, the interface next moves into its status screen display. It was here where I planned on taking full advantage of the 20 x 4 display size of my LCD, and decided to create some custom characters to include a fish icon on my status screen, as well as include an Aquaponics Fish Tank title. I began this status screen creation with some research on the creation of custom characters, where I found this Hackster.io article to give a good description of the topic. The article is linked to an online LCD Character Creator, where a GUI is provided that converts a drawn character into the hex codes that can be written to an LCD in code. I used this generator online to create a 2 x 3 character fish and was able to copy the generated characters generated into my LCD code. </p> <p></p> <p>I began the status screen code in the Void Loop function of my code, where I started by including an Aquaponics Fish Tank title printed at the top of the display. Following this, I called upon each of my 6 custom characters established earlier in the code, positioning each of them to create a 2 x 3 fish icon on the left side of the screen. The final touch to this first iteration of the status screen would be indicators for Temp, Humidity, and PH, each receiving their line in the interface. In this instance of the status screen, these indicators are just text displayed on a set line of the interface, to the right of the fish icon. All of this left me with the first iteration of the status screen, shown below.</p> <p> First Itteration of the Aquaponics Fish Tank LCD Statusscreen </p> <p>I began working from this interface in my week 14 class to include the sensor readings on my interface\u2019s status screen, altering the loop to read transmitting nodes via the software serial library, and print them to their proper interface positions, removing the setup Temp =, Humidity =, and PH = place holders in the process. </p> <p>The bulk of this communication setup work is discussed on my week 14 page, but I\u2019ll touch on the highlights on this function here. As mentioned above, this LCD networking feature in my system uses the software serial library. This library allows serial communications on any of a microcontroller\u2019s digital pins, and allows me to configure two receiving and transmitting pins on my mainboard node, and communicate with bus addresses to my two input nodes. My first step while implementing this library was to set up two communication ports in my mainboard code, one for communication with my systems temperature and humidity input node, and another for the PH input node. Through this setup, I\u2019m able to communicate across all three nodes, passing through these two set communication ports, and will be able to call on specific nodes with their defined addresses, portDHT and portPH.</p> <p>I call upon each of these different nodes throughout my mainboard interface code. Each port is started with the line \u2026</p> <pre><code> portDHT.listen();\n</code></pre> <p>as in the software serial library can only listen to one transmitting node through one port at a time, and then this data is saved to an incoming string. From here, the data is run through two of my code\u2019s parsing If statements, to determine whether the board is receiving temperature or humidity data, and the base of this, just as before, will print the read values to my LCD.</p> <p></p> <p>This same process is repeated in the Void Loop function, after the listing of portDHT, with portPH. This, just like the previous port, saves read data to a string, and then prints the read data to the proper line of the LCD interface, this time without any If statement due to the singular reading that will be coming in over this address.</p> <p></p> <p>All of these interface features and functions together left me with an LCD interface code capable of reading from transmitting sensor nodes and printing to the LCD, also including a startup routine with an included interface boot screen, as well as the main status screen with a custom fish icon. This final interface code, with all of these features implemented, is included below.</p> <pre><code>//(c) Teddy Warner 28 May 2021\n\n//This work may be reproduced, modified, distributed, performed, and displayed \n//for any purpose, but must acknowledge the Assistive Aquaponics Fish Tank. \n//Copyright is retained and must be preserved.

Although the timing circuit of my power breakout board worked great, the board itself did not. Unfortunately during the design process, I forgot to consider my usage of an inductive load, my water pump. Upon the first bootup of my system with this power breakout board, the circuit worked great, however, after cutting power to the system, my inductive water pump sent a current back into my breakout, destroying the timing circuit of the board. This board design left me facing the problem of always off grow lights after powering the water pump since when power is cut to a motor, like my water pump, the motion doesn\u2019t stop, and the excess current generated needs to go somewhere, in my case, my timing circuit. The fix for this use of an inductive load revolves around the use of a flyback diode, a feature I\u2019m familiar with from use on 3D Printers. </p> <p>With this solution in mind, I began the process of setting up a diode flyback protection circuit around my water pump terminals, starting with some research yielding these two articles, Simple Over-Voltage Protection Circuit using Zener Diodes &amp; How To Prevent an Inductive Load from Damaging Your Power Supply. Based off of the information in the first Simple Over-Voltage Protection Circuit using Zener Diodes article, I began work on modifying my power breakout schematic to include a Zener diode in parallel with the water pumps two terminals, orientated to direct any returning current into ground, and creating a new part of least resistance for the returning current. Due to the spec of the SMD Zener diode that was accessible to me, however, another component was needed, a current liming resistor. This resistor keeps the Zener diode from exploding on my board and reduces the current down to one the diode could handle, in my case I used a 100 ohms resistor. Unfortunately, this implementation only leads to more troubleshooting, as the current draw of the pump during its startup couldn\u2019t be matched with this Zener diode &amp; limiting resistor setup, so after a couple more iterations, I decided to take another approach, based more off of the information in the second article, How To Prevent an Inductive Load from Damaging Your Power Supply. This lead to the implementation of a second flyback diode setup, one where a Schottky diode is run in parallel with the water pumps terminal headers, along with a second in line with the input VCC to the system. In addition to this diode setup, I also completely isolated the voltage regulation setup for my pump, eliminating any connection to the timing circuit, and allowing for complete isolation of my inductive water pump load. In this instance, like the prior, the two diodes prevent a returning current from the water pump from reaching my voltage regulation circuitry, by creating a new path of least resistance to a GND line.

The structure is documented in-depth on my week 7 page, and again, for space concerns, this page will just tough on the important bits and highlights. </p> <p>Although I created a model of this wooden structure in Fusion 360 while planning the project, I began the structure creation process by starting to put some thought into the manufacturing processes I would need to take to produce this structure in real life. I settled on milling 6 different pieces to assemble the structure, one back wall, two sides, and 3 stacked pieces to make the base of the structure. I planned on creating these parts based on their corresponding components in my Fusion 360 design. For each of these pieces, I created a new sketch on the face of the profile and used Fusion 360\u2019s Project tool found under the Sketch menu to project all desired lines for each part into one single sketch in the Fusion 360 browser. With all of these lines in one single sketch for each of the 6 different components, I could export each sketch from the Fusion 360 browser onto my computer as a .dxf file by right-clicking on the sketch, and then selecting export as .dxf.</p> <p> Fusion Model with Projected Sketches for Each Component </p>"},{"location":"Projects/AssistiveAquaponics/#aspire-work-structure-milling","title":"Aspire Work &amp; Structure Milling","text":"<p>To generated the toolpaths I would later run on a CNC machine from my altered .svg files, I used Vectric CNC\u2019s Aspire CAM software. I firstly created a new file in Aspire, where I was prompted to set a workplane size. The workplane of the ShopBot PRSalpha, the CNC I would be milling on, was 96\u201d x 48\u201d, and my material height was 0.776\u201d, so I entered these value in the prompt accordingly. I then imported each of my .svg files into Aspire, nesting the files as I imported to reduce waste stock material. I spent a little more time with all of my files imported messing with the part orientation to ensure that there would be little stock material waste between my parts. In the assembly of my design, I planned to use milled tabs to align the back piece to the structure\u2019s two sidewalls and created this feature in my design. I then switched over to Aspires 3D View by clicking on the tab labeled 3D View at the top of the interface\u2019s workspace. Here I could start working on generating the different toolpaths for my parts. Throughout this process, I referenced my original Fusion 360 design to determine which sections of each of my files would require different toolpath operations. The first toolpath operation I generated was a Boreing operation that would boreholes for alignment dowels in the base of my structure. This operation was especially needed in my operation as I was not planning on switching to a drill bit anytime throughout the milling process, and this boreing operation allows me to mill these holes with an endmill instead. Nextly I generated Profile toolpaths for all of my parts, outlining each of my files, and cutting them out. I selected all intended profile cuts for each of my files and set the depth of each of these profile cuts to 0.776\u201d, the thickness of my stock material. This cut depth would ensure all of my profile cuts would go all the way through the material. Nextly I selected a .25 Endmill bit for both my profile and boreing operations, as this was the endmill I was planning on using. To prevent the movement of each of these parts after the profile cut completes, I added tabs to the toolpath under the Edit Tabs section of the toolpaths settings. These \u201cTabs\u201d leave a small bit of stock material connecting the profile to the rest of the stock and holding their position. I found adding 3 to 4 tabs per profile, depending on size and shape, worked best to hold my parts in place. The final tool paths I generated were pocket cuts. These toolpaths remove material to add depth to some of my parts. These pockets were relatively straightforward, as they didn\u2019t require any added tabs because they cont cut through the material, however, I used a different, larger, bit size for these pockets to speed up milling time, so I was required to change that. Finally, before exporting any of these toolpaths, I went back through and turned on \u201cRamping\u201d for each operation. This setting diagonally moves the Endmill bit, as opposed to vertical plunges and then horizontal movement, allowing the side of the endmill to cut material as intended. I saved all of these toolpaths from Aspire through the Save Toolpath menu. Each of these toolpaths was saved under the Shopbot format, .sbp, and grouped based on the bit used. This left me with 3 different .sbp files for each a 1/8\u201d, 1/4\u201d, and 1/2\u201d bit.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>I began by prepping my machine with the proper bit and mounted my stock to the machine\u2019s bed. My classmate Graham Smith and I did all of our millings this week together as the operation of a machine on this scale can be unsafe if the right precautions are not taken, or if operated alone. I loaded my first tool path, my 1/2\u201d pocket operation, into the Shopbot Command Console through the Load File menu under the File tab. I selected my .sbp toolpath, and under the pop-up menu, selected 3D Offset as the operations offset, and then proceeded to click enter to start the cut. This \u201c3D Offset\u201d allows for me to complete an \u201cAir Cut\u201d of my file, where the tool doesn\u2019t engage with my stock material but just runs above it. I ran this Air Cut to ensure my part placement fit with the side of the machine\u2019s workspace limits, and also didn\u2019t run into any screws. This test of cutting air was successful, so I was ready to move onto the real milling operation. I loaded the file into Shopbot Command Console following the same steps taken previously, but this time I left the offset dropdown set to the default No Offset as opposed to 3D offset, so the machine would run another air cut. Before running this operation, I ensured the dust collection was turned on, and then clicked the enter key to start the operation.</p> <p>The assembly and post-processing work on this wooden tank structure is well documented on my week 7 computer-controlled machining class page, and that work will not be documented in-depth again on this page for space reasons, however, the final assembled and post-processed beauty shots are included below.</p> <p> </p> Final Shots of Sanded Fish Tank Structure <p>After the completion of my tanks structure in my week 7 class, a couple of additions had to be made to allow for the mounting of a mains AC input, my front panel electronics, as well as a mount for my tanks grow lights. Beginning with the mount for my mains AC adapter, I used a paddle bit on my drill to take out some material in the shape of the adapter on the back of the tank, before finishing up the rectangle with a chisel, using the adapter as a reference until reaching a press-fit install. I also drilled two M4 mounting holes with this adapter as a reference, allowing for a secure attachment of the adapter to the frame.</p> <p> Mains AC Adapter and Switch Box Mounting Hole </p> <p>The cables from this adapter are routed through this pocket on the back of my tank, and into the underside electronics enclosure before the adapter is mounted to the frame with M4 bolts, as shown in the images below. Note these M4 screws were just a place holder and were replaced with some nice matching matte black M4 bolts, allowing for a cleaner adapter look.</p> <p> </p> <p>The next addition to my plywood tank structure is the grow light mounting bard, which ran across between the two highest points of my structure. This bar is made out of some scrap plywood from my tanks CNC job, and I ripped it down to size on a table saw, before tweaking the height to match that of its mounts on a bandsaw. I used the same tactics sued to assemble the tank structure to mount this light bar, with something dowels for alignment, with wood glue to hold. Underneath this bar, on the side that will be facing the eventual plant box, I mounted three rows of Grow Light Strips, a strip of special neo pixels with light frequencies meant to help plant growth. In my particular case, I used 4 red : 1 blue strip, and alternated the mounting of the three rows to offset this pattern.</p> <p></p> <p>The final modification needed on my plywood tank structure was a pocket allowing for the mounting of my front panel\u2019s electronics, a switch, and my tank\u2019s LCD. I spent a while pinpointing the location and sizing of this box, as to not interfere with the lip holding the acrylic panel over my electronics enclosure, a feature discussed later on this page. I used a speed square and a Metric/Imperial ruler to draw out a pocket large enough to fit the two needed components, with some additional space for wiring, considering the restrictions of the area throughout. </p> <p> Front Panle Electronics Clearence Hole Layout </p> <p>I then followed the same approach taken to remove material for my mains AC adapter mount, starting by removing material with paddle bits and my drill, before cleaning up with a chisel. This hole will eventually be completely covered with the front panel of my tank, so I wasn\u2019t too concerned with the appearance of this one. After all the material was removed, I was left with the clearance hole, shown below.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"Projects/AssistiveAquaponics/#tank-front-plate","title":"Tank Front Plate","text":"<p>To cover up this newly carved electronics clearance hole, and also complete the side symmetry of my plywood structure, my next step was to laser cut my tank structure\u2019s front plate.

I mocked this plate up to hold my system\u2019s LCD and a light power switch over the physical cut clearance hole and then added in some icons to the plate, including a TW logo, as well as a light on and light off icon.</p> <p>I saved this Fusion 360 sketch as a .dxf and imported the file into CorelDRAW, where I could then, following the same process I took in week 3, could run this file on our lab\u2019s Fusion Pro 48 laser cutter.

I wanted to reduce as much laser residue and char on this piece as possible, so I weighted this piece down to the bed of the laser before focusing on the laser, and starting the job.

The tank, in its simplest form, is 5 acrylic panels cut on a laser cutter, and bonded together to form the tank itself with WeldOn 16. However just a plain acrylic box like this is a little too basic, and taking inspiration from an assignment completed by 7th-grade engineering classes in our lab, I decided to etch something on the back wall of my tank. This assignment I took inspiration from is a pretty simple project completed by our lab\u2019s seventh graders as an intro to the laser cutter. The gist of the assignment involves laser-cutting and etching an acrylic sign, and then shining a neopixel strip down on the acrylic, lighting up the etched portion of the assignment. My fish tank will include white neopixel light strips on the inside of the tank as accent lighting, and an etched back wall of my fishtank would complement well with these lights, just like the seventh-grade sign project. Although I didn\u2019t know for sure what I would be etched into this back panel yet, I knew I wanted this design to align with the four cutouts on the back wall of my wooden tank structure, so I began this tank design work referencing my physical wooden tank structure. I used Inkscape to create the tank\u2019s basic 5 rectangles, so four outer walls would all sit on a larger tank baseplate. From here, referencing the wooden structure again, I projected the cutouts of my structure\u2019s back wall to the back panel, giving me a workspace to include my future design. During all this Inkscape work, I remembered a conversation between one of my instructors, Mr. Tom Ducick and our Fab group, where Mr. Dubick brought up the inclusion of our Eagle designs outside of circuit boards. For the back panel of my fish tank, I decided on embedding an SVG exported from my first mainboard attempt made all the back in week 6. I used Inkscape\u2019s Intercect tool to crop this SVG down into the back walls four design slots. My final bit of work on this tank design fell on this back panel design again, as after meeting with another one of my instructors Dr. Terence Fagan, the point was brought up that as sweet as the etched original circuit board would look on the back panel of the tank, my final project is a fish tank, something that is more organic and doesn\u2019t make you think of something as modern looking as the sharpe traces of a circuit board. To combat this, I increased the nodes of this back panel design in Inkscape, and then also increased the designs beziers, until left with something still legible as my original circuit board, but less sharp and with more organic curves, leaving me with the finished fish tank design in Inkscape, shown below.</p> <p></p> <p>I exported this Inkscape design as an SVG file, and then opened the file into CorelDRAW, and following the workflow for laser cutting I used in my week 3 class, I ran this tank file on a sheet of 1/4\u201d clear acrylic on our lab\u2019s Fusion Pro 48 laser cutter.</p> <p>This job left me with the 5 panels of my tank, ready to assemble</p> <p></p> <p>As mentioned earlier, for the panel assembly of my tank, I\u2019m using WeldOn 16 to bond all of my acrylic panels together. This bonding process was super time-consuming, as each run with Weldon 16 required a 24 hour set time to completely bond. Despite this long total set time, the work time of WeldOn 16 is only a little over a minute, so all of my application had to be clean and quick. I used a set of two 90 degrees angle clamps to hold my tank\u2019s panels in place while using WeldOn 16 and left the clamps on through the 24 hours set time for each individual corner to allow for a square tank. Below is an image of the last bonding run for the tank\u2019s sidewalls.</p> <p></p> <p>The longes part of the tank assembly was all 4 of the sidewalls of the tank, and after this 4-day process was complete, I followed the same application process for the bottom of the tank, this time holding the pieces in place with some painters tape along all edges, as well as across both pieces, shown below.</p> <p></p> <p>After this final bit of bonding was entirely set, I went to test out by tank, setting the tank up on a sheet of cardboard to see if any water leaked out, and unfortunately, it did \u2026 a lot. </p> <p></p> <p>I found that although WeldOn 16 worked great for the structure of my tank, and allowed for a secure bond between all of the tanks panels, it didn\u2019t leave a watertight seal. This problem was simply fixed, however, with the application of silicon to the interior edges of my tank. During this step finding an Aquarium-Safe Silicone is super important, as to not kill any future fish. I found this article on Aquarium-Safe Silicones to be a super helpful reference while picking one of these, and with the article as a reference, was able to pick a tank safe silicone out from my local hardware store. </p> <p>The application process for this silicone was worlds easier than the previous WeldOn 16 work, due to the large working window with the product, and ability to do all of my tanks edges at once. I worked through starting with the four bottom edges of my tank, before tackling the four vertices, and then taking out any high spots on these lines with a popsicle stick.</p> <p></p> <p>The set time for this silicone was only 15 hours, but 24 was recommended on my brand\u2019s datasheet before exposer to water, so after this time, another watertight test of my tank was in order. I set up my silicone sealed tank of some sheets of dry computer paper, to reveal any leaks right away. I stress tested the sealed tank, filling it up to the brim with water, and then allowing the tank to sit for 3 hours, checking back on it around every 30 minutes. This test yielded successful results, with no water on the computer paper, and dry external semes on the tank, leaving with finally, with a fish ready tank!</p> <p> Water-Tight Test on Sealed Tank - Three Hour Mark </p> <p> BTT Rubber Duckies Enjoying the Water-Tight Tank </p>"},{"location":"Projects/AssistiveAquaponics/#plant-box-3d-printing","title":"Plant Box - 3D Printing","text":"<p>Following the acrylic fish tank, the aqua part of the aquaponics system, it was time to move onto my tank\u2019s plant box, covering the system ponics side.

PETG is not only one of my favorite filaments to print in, but also considered a watertight material, and when not colored and left white, is also fish tank safe.</p> <p>With the manufacturing process in mind, I began work on the plant box\u2019s CAD in Fusion 360. The CAD for this part is pretty complex, including not just water routing from a connection port on the bottom of the part, but also a water directing reflow system, and cable management with board mounts incorporated in the design. The part is split into four separate sections, to allow for optimal print orientation on my printer\u2019s bed. These four pieces align with three mounting alignment holes for embedded M3 nuts and bolts, and these same alignment screws are used to secure the four sections together.</p> Final Plant Box Itteration in Fusion 360 <p>After the completion of all design work for my tank\u2019s plant box, the tedious process of manufacturing was ready to begin. In total, all four parts of the plant box took just over 72 hours to print. Each of the printed parts went through a couple of extra steps in the slicing process, where the plant box\u2019s water tightness would be ensured. The basic premise of a watertight component relates very closely to the density of that component. With this in mind, each of the four plant box parts are sliced with four perimeters, and with a 10% gyroid infill, an infill type with super high strength along with a low weight (less filament usage). Each of these parts runs at a 0.20mm layer height, allowing for a relatively high part density while keeping a lower number of layer lines, places where water could seep into the print. After all of this, I used Prusa SLicer\u2019s ( my slicer of choice) Paint on Supports tool, to add supports to the aspects of my print where they were needed. This step, as opposed to auto-generating the supports allowed me to keep the internal water pipes of my part intact and usable without supports clogging them, shown in the inspected slicing image below.</p> <p></p> <p>This slicing setup process was used across all four parts of my tank plant box, and after a ton of print time, I was left with the task of assembly. As mentioned above, my CAD design for this part includes alignment pins for all four of the plant box\u2019s sections. After cleaning up the supports from each of these sections, I inserted the embedded M3 nuts used in this alignment setup and dry-fit the four parts together with the alignment M3 bolts. After this, I repeated the same assembly process, this time using the same silicone used to seal my tank on all of the inside surfaces on my plant box sections, leaving me with the assembled part below\u2026</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"Projects/AssistiveAquaponics/#electronics-mounting-cable-managment-3d-printing","title":"Electronics Mounting &amp; Cable Managment- 3D Printing","text":"<p>Following the plant box system of my assistive aquaponics fish tank, a plethora of other small bits and pieces helping with the system integration of my part were also made with the 3d printing workflow. Due to a large number of these small bits, and their relative simpleness, instead of taking a deep dive into the concept behind each design and the manufacturing of the part, I\u2019ll just hit some design concept highlights in this paragraph, and include the CAD and manufacture a part for each piece below. All of these parts are mounts of one kind or another, either press fit for boards, or bolt down for cables/sensors. A lot of these pieces serve as a visual benefit just as much as their purpose of mounting and cable management. With this in mind, many of the pieces are designed with a framing drafted banding around the edge. Inspiration from this angled framing came from my time in my 8th-grade art class, where I was taught the practice of directing a viewer\u2019s vision. The angled frame of a lot of these mounts serves to direct your vision inward, away from the frame itself. In addition to the angled nature of these mounts, any part I\u2019m wishing to achieve this effect with is printed from a black PETG, assisting in the directing of vision away from them, as they don\u2019t \u2018pop\u2019. A good example of this effect is seen in the Fish Bowl Board Mount part included below. This mount, for my fishbowl mainboard, uses the framing draft angle technique, along with the black filament color to direct one\u2019s eyes towards the center of the board, where the microchip is located, upon first glance.</p>"},{"location":"Projects/AssistiveAquaponics/#fish-bowl-board-mount","title":"Fish Bowl Board Mount","text":"Board Prototype Fitted in Fish Bowl Board Mount"},{"location":"Projects/AssistiveAquaponics/#jumper-cable-mounts","title":"Jumper Cable Mounts","text":"12x Jumper Mount On Jumper Cables"},{"location":"Projects/AssistiveAquaponics/#psu-mounting-brackets","title":"PSU Mounting Brackets","text":"Power Supply Mounting Brackets After Cleanup Power Supply Mounts Attached to PSU"},{"location":"Projects/AssistiveAquaponics/#wire-grommet","title":"Wire Grommet","text":"Back Wire Grommet After Cleanup Back Wire Grommet Fitted to Wire Passthrough Hole"},{"location":"Projects/AssistiveAquaponics/#psu-terminal-cover","title":"PSU Terminal Cover","text":"PSU Terminal Cover Plate After Cleanup PSU Terminal Cover Mounted to PSU Terminals"},{"location":"Projects/AssistiveAquaponics/#power-breakout-board-mount","title":"Power Breakout Board Mount","text":"Power Breakout Board Fitted in Board Mount"},{"location":"Projects/AssistiveAquaponics/#ph-boards-mounts","title":"pH Boards Mounts","text":"pH electrical Isolation Board Mounted on Board Mount"},{"location":"Projects/AssistiveAquaponics/#ph-probe-mount","title":"pH Probe Mount","text":"Assembled pH Probe Mount After Cleanup"},{"location":"Projects/AssistiveAquaponics/#cable-bundle-mounting-clips","title":"Cable Bundle Mounting Clips","text":"Cable Bundle Clip Mounted to Back of Tank Structure"},{"location":"Projects/AssistiveAquaponics/#system-assembly-testing","title":"System Assembly &amp; Testing","text":"<p>Due to the countless design hours spent planning the assembly of my entire tank, this process had plenty of digital references, making the most time-consuming process of the assembly the one, not digitally planned aspect, cable management. I began the assembly process on this task, beginning with the connection of my power supply to mains via the inlaid AC adapter in my tank structure. Due to the dangerously high voltages in these terminals, I followed best practices for the connecting of these wires, using crimp-on connectors for each wire connected to these terminals, as well as grounding the whole system, and including an AC adapter with a 250v fuze.</p> <p> </p> Power Supply Terminal Wireing <p>As included above, these PSU terminals have a 3d printed terminal cover plate, to provide a little extra protection from any accidental bumps into the terminals. After completing the terminal wiring of the PSU, I installed this terminal cover plate, screwing it down to the wooden plate with M3 screws. I then, with the installed PSU as a reference, found the center of the remaining chunk of the electronics compartment and installed my printed fishbowl main board mount.</p> <p> </p> Begining of System Integraiton - PSU and Main Board <p>Taking a break from cable management for a bit, It was time to begin the incorporation of my tank\u2019s subsystems into my plywood tank structure, beginning with my acrylic fish tank. The tank was designed to be an exact fit in this plywood structure, and after real-world fabrication, fit in the structure tight enough to stay put without adhesives of fasteners, even when upsidedown. For the installation of the acrylic tank into the plywood structure, I used four wood clamps long enough to span the width/length of both pieces, and then used the clamps to slowly and evenly press the tank into the structure so it sat flush on all four connecting walls. Following this, I then reattached the structure\u2019s laser-cut front panel with some brass furniture screws.</p> <p> </p> Acrylic Fish Tank Installed in Plywood Structure <p>Next, I began preparing the next subsystem of my tank, the plant box. Due to the predesigned cable management features, the process of including the necessary components here was pretty straightforward. I first routed the tank light strips along their channel, using the zip tie cable mount and cable passthrough to route the cables out the back grommet hole of the plant box. From here I routed a wire that would later be connected to the tank\u2019s water pump and finally moved onto the inlaying of the fishbowl board. Behind this board inlay is a little channel meant for the jumpers to run through while attached to the backside of the board. I connected these jumpers to their pins on my fish board, super glued them in place, and took a picture for reference later, as the wires will next be completely hidden. Then, I pressed the board into its corresponding slot, followed by its press-fit laser cut acrylic cover, and sealed around any gaps with silicon. This left me, as shown below, with a mounted sensor board with only the sensor itself exposed.</p> <p> </p> Bottom of Plant Box After Electronics &amp; Cable Installation <p>I was then ready to press this plant box into place, with all of its mounted electronics. The plant box follows the same tight press fit mounting principle as the previous acrylic tank, however instead of using clamps, I slowly worked the assembled plant box back into position, until aligned with the acrylic fish tank and plywood structure, shown below.</p> <p></p> <p> </p> Plant Box Installed in Tank Structure Above Acrylic Tank <p>While pressing the plant box into position, I was sure to route and keep the structures grow light wires in their cable passthrough on the side of the plant box, yielding some nice clean cable routing across the components of the whole system.</p> <p> </p> Grow Light Cables Routed Through Plant Box Cable Passthrough <p>After the installation of all this, a test of the newly installed lights was in order, and I hooked up both my tank\u2019s grow &amp; tank lights to a power supply set to 12v and turned them on.</p> <p> </p> System Grow &amp; Tank Lights Testing <p>With the bulk of the structure assembly done, I next began the mounting and integration process, starting with the internal tank components like the pH probe. I attached both printed probe clamps to my pH probe and then used some silicone to stick it in the back left corner of my tank, where the probe cable routed up through the plant box, hidden away.</p> <p> </p> pH Probe Mounted in Back Left Tank Corner <p>Following the pH probe, next up in the tank itself was the water pump. I first connected the pump to the plant box via both a bit of silicone tubing cut to length and then hose clamped and siliconed in place, as well as with connection between the pump\u2019s cable and the router pump wires installed previously. I then used the pump\u2019s two included mounts to stick the pump down to the tank floor with silicone.</p> <p> </p> Water Pump Connected &amp; Installed in Tank <p>Once all contents of the tank/plant box systems were embedded, I could move on routing their cables down to my structure\u2019s main electronics compartment. I used the 3D-printed cable clips printed earlier to route these cables down the back of my tank, between the two included wire grommets. I wrapped all of these cables with some cable wrap I had laying around from and Ender 3 mod I had done.</p> <p> </p> Cable Routing From Plant Box to Electronics Compartment <p>These routed cables run through the cable passthrough grommet on the backside of the tank and then slot through their cable route in the PSU terminal cover plate, until out the other side. From here the bulk of cable management began, starting with the power breakout system. I mounted the power breakout board on its 3D printed mount right below the fishbowl mainboard, and then connected the correct incoming and outgoing wires to their connected headers while referencing my eagle power breakout board file. Each of these cables was screwed into their terminal headers before the board was mounted down to the wooden base. From here I began the mounting of the 3 remaining pH boards, two of which sit to the left of my mainboard, and one just off-centered above. These three boards mount via press-fit mounts &amp; their mounting holes, two boards with 3mm holes, and one with 4mm. I then connected the incoming pH probe cable to its terminal, and wired the three pH boards together, before moving onto the main data wiring. Using all of my testing media as a reference, I made the jumper connections for all of the lines in my electronics enclosure, coming from the pH board, temp/humidity sensor, LCD, and light switch, and with that had an integrated system.</p> <p> </p> All Board Mounted Electronics Compartment <p>Although I had wired all of my connections with mounted boards in my electronics enclosure, I finished the system integration process with some additional cable management via jumper cable mounts.</p> <p> </p> Final Cable Managed Electronics Compartment <p>\u2026 and, with all this assembly &amp; integration work done, it was time for final testing. Below is a successful demonstration of my tank\u2019s electronics system. Just a note, in this video, my tank\u2019s pump is disconnected, because it\u2019s never good to run a water pump outside of water. Instead of leaving this pump connected during the testing of the electronics system, I tested the voltage and current from the pump cables run under the plant box.</p> <p>Finally, came the water test. Despite the number of water tests I had done with the subsystems before, and the proof of their watertight features, this test was damn stressful leading up to it, due to the inclusion of all my electronics in my system on this test. I prepared a spot outside where I could test my tank, and then began preparing the tank, first by filling the plant box with my LECA grow medium \u2026</p> <p></p> <p>\u2026 and next, by filling the tank itself. I did this with the help of a couple of my fab groupmates and was able to use a spare water pump and some excess silicone tubing to pump water into my fish tank, without concern of spilling around the base of the tank, where its electronics are located.</p> <p>Unsurprisingly, but to my relief, the filling of the tank went smoothly, and there was absolutely no spillage/leakes anywhere in the whole system, leaving me with the last remaining tank \u2026 turning it on.</p> <p>it worked!, upon bootup, water begins flowing through the system, and draining out through the plant boxes draining feature, at the same time as the electronics system is taking measurements from the system and displaying it all of the tanks embedded front LCD. </p>"},{"location":"Projects/CornerDesk/","title":"Cable Managed Corner Desk","text":"<p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p></p> <ul> <li>01 Home</li> <li>02 Projects</li> <li>03 Writing</li> </ul>  Project Feed"},{"location":"Projects/CornerDesk/#cable-managed-corner-desk","title":"Cable Managed Corner Desk","text":"Teddy Warner| Spring, 2020 |  6-8 minutes <p>This start of the Pandemic project stemmed from my freshman year engineering capstone project.

I settled on a frame and cabinet of 2x4s and some plywood that was painted white pretty quickly, but the top took some more thought. Eventually, I decided to make the top out of cedar planks that were stained with Provincial to match the stain of the floor in my room. Also at lowes, I picked up a Kreg-Jig to drill pocket holes for the desk, as I didn\u2019t like the idea of screws being visible.

Instead of attaching the Cedar top directly to the frame, it\u2019s held by 3d Printed mounts that allow the top to expand and contract a whole lot more without becoming loose.

Not only can you jeopardize your stock material, but incorrect feeds and speeds can also yield a hazardous environment &amp; potential machine damage. There is no streamlined answer to find the right feeds and speeds, ideal values depend on numerous variables &amp; feeds and speeds may not remain constant from job to job. This section provides a starting place for feeds and speeds, with general values provided as well as a calculator for the required inputs in your toolpath. This is by no means a universal key and necessary precautions &amp; alterations should be made to provide values to mesh with your manufacturing workflow. Often the manufacturer of your tool &amp; your machine will provide generic feeds and speeds for your specific equipment. Operator input is required to achieve successful &amp; safe cuts, often you\u2019ll be able to hear machine strain - a telltale sign of poor cutting. Trial and error adjusting is necessary to achieve the sweet spot for your feeds and speeds.  </p> Feeds &amp; Speeds Terminology <code>Tool Diameter</code> <p>The diameter of the endmill. When Profile milling or Through Cutting stock, it is best to keep the Tool Diameter \u2265 1/6 Stock Thickness, preserving the integrity of the endmill while allowing for full passes. Larger tool diameters yield shorter cut times when removing a lot of material, while smaller diameters allow for higher detail to be reached. It is typically best to utilize both larger and smaller diameter endmills, using the larger to clear the bulk of stock material, while finishing the mill with a smaller diameter tool to achieve the best detail. </p> <p> </p> <code>Flute Count</code> <p>The number of individual flutes an endmill has. Flutes are the upward running cutting edges on an endmill. Lower flute counts allow for better chip &amp; heat clearance from the cutting edge, while higher flute counts provided a smoother finish to a part. Stock materials that require a high surface speed also require higher flute bits, and vice versa with lower surface speed requirements. One to Two flute bits will suffice for prototyping with soft plastics &amp; waxes. Two or more flutes will typically be needed for harder plastics (such as HDPE), woods, and metals.</p> <p> </p> <code>Surface Speed</code> <p>The speed at which the tool\u2019s cutting edge travels through the stock. Surface Speed is dependent on both the stock &amp; endmill materials. Maximum surface speeds are typically published by your endmill\u2019s manufacturer and do not need to be derived experimentally. Staring jobs at \u2264 50% of the maximum provided value is the best practice to allow for ample time to ensure the successful operation of your machine.</p> <p> </p> <code>Chip Load</code> <p>The thickness of offcut \u2018chips\u2019 removed with each flute per revolution of the endmill. Maximum chip load is typically provided by the endmill\u2019s manufacturer, based upon the tool\u2019s characteristics. Finding a balance between chip load extremes is crucial for the safety of you and your machine. While larger chip loads yield shorter machine time, they also put greater forces on your endmill, potentially pushing the bit towards its point of rupture. On the other hand, smaller chip loads increase machine time, while expelling waste and heat from the tool at a slower pace, thus risking overheating and potential fire. Safe chip load values usually fall between 0.001\u201d &amp; 0.010\u201d0.0254mm &amp; 0.254mm.</p> <p> </p> <code>Spindle Speed</code> <p>The number of revolutions made by the endmill in a unit of time (RPM is standard). A Lower RPM yields a higher quality surface finish &amp; more cutting power, while a higher RPM decreases machine time. For optimal milling operations, use a higher RPM for roughing passes &amp; a lower for finishing.</p> <p> </p> \\[ Spindle Speed (RPM) = {Surface Speed (ft/min) \\over \u03c0 \u2217 {1 \\over 12} \u2217 Tool Diameter (in)} \\] <p> \\[ Spindle Speed (RPM) = {Surface Speed (M/min) \\over \u03c0 \u2217 {1 \\over 1000} \u2217 Tool Diameter (mm)} \\] <code>Feed Rate</code> <p>The speed at which the machine moves the tool through the stock. Finding the right feed rate is crucial for the safety of you and your machine. Excessively high feed rates cause excessive load on the cutter, leading to cataclysmic failure of the endmill, spindle, and machine. Feed rates that are too low produce unnecessary vibration on the machine, leading to poor surface finishes &amp; potential cutter failure.</p> <p> </p> \\[ Feed Rate (in/min) = Spindle Speed (RPM) \u2217 Flute Count \u2217 Chip Load (in) \\] <p> \\[ Feed Rate (mm/min) = Spindle Speed (RPM) \u2217 Flute Count \u2217 Chip Load (mm) \\] <code>Plunge Rate</code> <p>The speed at which the endmill is driven down into the stock. The vertically running flutes on an endmill allow the tool to cut horizontally, while vertical plunges are more demanding on the tool. Lower plunge rates prevent tool damage &amp; maintain lower temperatures while boring holes. All plunging cuts should be ramped, as gradual plunging while traveling across the stock will reduce tool stress.</p> <p> </p> \\[ Plunge Rate(in/min) = Feed Rate (in/min) * {1 \\over 2} \\] <p> \\[ Plunge Rate(mm/min) = Feed Rate (mm/min) * {1 \\over 2} \\] <code>Stepdown</code> <p>The vertical depth of each pass of the tool into the stock. Best practice is to maintain a step down of \u2264 50% of the tool diameter, however, may be increased while milling softer materials. The step down should always remain less than the tool diameter.</p> <p> </p> \\[ Stepover(in) = Tool Diameter (in) * {3 \\over 5} \\] <p> \\[ Stepover(mm) = Tool Diameter (mm) * {3 \\over 5} \\] <code>Stepover</code> <p>The space between passes of the tool into the stock.

Below I\u2019ve compiled a table of commonly milled stock materials, ranging from woods to plastics to metals.

The machine\u2019s Z-carriage comes equipped with a claw-like end that can grab the machine\u2019s two inverted-frustum-shaped tools: a cheese and a sauce hopper. These hoppers will hang from mounts on the machine\u2019s frame from contact at their smaller diameters, and are picked up by moving the machine\u2019s claw just above these mounts, and sliding up to mesh with the larger top diameter of the hoppers. Thus, our CNC needs a z-axis to move the machine\u2019s claw up and down along the inverted-frustrum\u2019s surface. With this in mind, I began work modeling our CNC\u2019s Z-carriage in Fusion 360.</p> <p>The carriage itself is a rather simple piece, using linear bearings to move along the y-axis rods, with two underside slots running parallel to each other to hold the bearings in place. Both of these slots run the length of the carriage, however towards the center of the slots, there is a small lip up, allowing the steel rods to still move while holding the linear bearings in the four corners, at the ends of each slot. The final bit to this design is a bolt-on endcap for two of the sides of the carriage, ensuring the bearings don\u2019t leave the carriage\u2019s slots.</p> <p></p> <p>From here, I added two little features near the two endcaps, allowing for the Y-axis belt to be clamped to the carriage. The carriage will be pulled along the axis by this belt, attached to a stepper motor and idler on each end of the steel rods. These little features stray off the carriages centerline to the left, allowing for the belt running towards the right of the carriage to be unaltered. Each of the belt clips has a slot with matching teeth to mesh with the Y-axis belt, allowing for the feature to hold the belt without slipping.</p> <p>With the Y-axis motion of the carriage flattened out, I began the Z-axis design. To keep as much carriage bulk towards it\u2019s center, I began by positioning a stepper motor mount at the top middle of the carriage body. The machine will use this downwards-facing stepper, coupled to an 8mm threaded rod with a coupler and support bearing to drive the it\u2019s claw end. Because this rod will be hanging down from the coupler, the carriage design fits a bearing below the stepper and coupler assembly, to support the coupler and allow for a smooth rotation. Along with this threaded rod, the Z-axis uses two linear steel rods, attached to the bottom of the carriage and to a small bottom bracket to create a track for the axis to move on. These rods are the same style as those used on the machine\u2019s Y-axis. The final piece to this carriage involved endstop mounting. To home the Z-axis before machine use, I modeled an endstop switch mounting face, along with some mounting screw holes into the bottom connecting piece between the two steel rods.</p> <p></p> <p>The final bit to this carriage puzzle was the Z-axis claw. Similar to the carriage itself, this claw utilizes linear bearings to roll vertically on the Z-axis\u2019s two steel rods. The claw is driven up and down by the 8mm threaded rod attached to the Z-axis stepper motor, meshing with the rod\u2019s corresponding threaded nut. The pass-through hole for this nut is designed to allow the nut to sit flush with the top surface of the claw and can be inserted into the claw as you would a brass insert, by heating the nut with a soldering iron, while applying pressure to guild the nut into the hole. Next to the claws\u2019 nut is a small feature laying on the underside of the claw. This jut-out box ensures the Z-axis endstop hits the claw before the claw\u2019s linear bearings hit the bottom of the axis. From this feature, the claw ramps up into the hopper-holding end. This end consists of a 240-degree semi-circle, allowing for the end to slide into the bottom end of the hopper, and the rais to lock the hopper in the semi-circle. This claw was finished up with a small chef hat icon, which I imported into Fusion as an SVG before extruding the outlines of the design into some of the claw\u2019s space. Below is the finished Z-Axis Carriage model, including the Y-axis motion, Z-Axis, and the claw of the machines.</p> <p>With the carriage flattened out, I derived this Z-Carriage model into a communal machine render my friends and I shared, moving the component to run along the two Y-axis steel rods.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"Projects/PizzaPizza/#endstops-belt-tensions","title":"Endstops &amp; Belt Tensions","text":"<p>I next began work on the Pizza-Pizza CNC Machine\u2019s gantry alongside my friend, Graham Smith. I developed the X-Axis belts and endstop, while Graham dealt with the Y-axis. I began this work off of one of the corner brackets Graham had modeled in a shared Pizza-Pizza CNC Machine render while I was working on the machine\u2019s carriage. These corners are mirrors across all eight of the corners of the machine, connecting three different pieces of aluminum extrusion to form the frame of the machine. I created a feature off of one of these corners, allowing a stepper belt to be fastened, and tensioned with a screw. The motion on this axis is driven along with these belts by two stepper motors on 3D-printed brackets. The belts on this axis themselves are stationary, spanning from corner to corner, running through an idler bearing, then around the stepper motors belt coupler, and then back around another idler bearing, before reaching the other corner. The two idler bearings ensure the belt is taut around the motor\u2019s belt coupler, and therefore, when the stepper steps, the axis is pulled along the taut belt. The features modeled into the side corner hold one end of this motion belt in line with the idler bearings, and wrap the end of the belt around a tensioning mechanism, before locking the belt in place in a slot with meshing teeth to hold the belt from slipping. The basic premise of the belt tensioner stems from the rotation of a screw through a slotted nut, pushing the end of the screw further into the feature. At the end of this screw is a small semi-elliptical shape that directs the force coming from the screw into the belt wrapped around it. This belt tensioning feature was needed on all four of the machine\u2019s upper corners, so upon the completion of the feature in one corner, I used some construction midplanes, and Fusion 360\u2019s mirror tool to mirror the feature to each of the four different upper corners.</p> <p></p> <p>With the X-axis motion done, I moved on to the axis\u2019s one endstop, which will allow our machine to home its X-axis to the switch before usage. The mount for this endstop switch is not overly complicated, attaching a switch holding bracket to the top of the 2020 aluminum extrusion t-slots. The feature uses an M4 bolt and corresponding T-Bolt to attach the bracket to the top of the extrusion through a hole in the bracket. From here the feature stems up to a slot that holds an endstop switch in line with the machine\u2019s X-axis carriage. The switch is held in this slot by its bottom screw hole, using an M2 bolt and nut. I positioned this endstop in the back right of the machine, keeping the endstop away from the cluttered front of the machine, and the switch\u2019s cable distanced as close to the electronic enclosure as possible. The feature can be seen mounted in this position in our final Pizza Pizza CNC render shown below.</p>"},{"location":"Projects/PizzaPizza/#electronic-housing","title":"Electronic Housing","text":"<p>Along with the prior carriage, belt tensioner, and endstop CAD work, I dealt with the brain and blood of our Pizza-Pizza CNC, the electronics system. The system is built around a Mini RAMBo - or RepRap Arduino-Mega-compatible Mother Board - controller board. The Mini RAMBo is a smaller version of the RAMBo controller board, a board based on the Arduino MEGA, including four individual stepper motor drivers and MOSFET switched outputs. This board worked great in the case of our machine, as not only is it a powerful, compact, and easily manipulated controller board, we were able to scrap the board from one of our lab\u2019s old out-of-commission Luzbot Mini 3d printers. This Mini RAMBo controls the machine\u2019s three-axis through four different stepper motors, one wired to the Z-axis, one to the Y-axis, and one stepper port wired to two different X-axis steppers. These steppers work with their corresponding endstops, also wired to the Mini RAMBo, to home and locate the machine. The Mini RAMBo also controlled the machine\u2019s two toolend servos, as well as a full graphic LCD panel to display machine menus and status. The graphical LCD used in the electronics system is a scrapped Creality Ender 3 LCD panel. This whole system is powered by a 12-volt DC power supply, converting 110-volt American AC wall power into the 12-volts needed by the system.</p> <p></p> <p>As a complement to the importance of the machine electronics system, I began designing and modeling a separate electronic enclosure that would sit independently to the side of the machine. I started the CAD work for this enclosure in Fusion 360 with not only the goal of fitting all electronics inside, but also maintaining decent-looking cable management, and proper ventilation. It\u2019s worth a second noting that this encloser will not hold the machine\u2019s power supply, as it\u2019s usually not best practice to put the hot PSU next to the controller, so the electronic closer will be connected to the PSU with some hookup wire. I started by tracing the two main boards of the system, the Mini RAMBo, and Creality Ender 3 LCD, in Fusion 360. I then started work on the body of the encloser itself, designing the base around the traced Mini RAMBo, and extruding up this base to make an encloser. From here I used a profile sketch of the LCD panel to draft a slanted face on the enclosure, where the LCD would mount, an angle for easy viewing, and minimal screen glare. The final bit allowing these two mainboards to fit in the enclosure is space for the Mini RAMBo\u2019s USB port to pass through to the back of the enclosure. The USB port access allowed me to continue to update the board\u2019s firmware while the electronics were in the enclosure.</p> <p></p> <p>Before continuing with the rest of the enclosure, I began the process of splitting up the pre-existing body into different components, and also creating new bodies and components for the enclosure\u2019s lid, wire grommet, and LCD knob. I spit these components up to make the 3D printing process as pain-free as possible, keeping in mind the limits of 3D printing while doing so. I ended up with four different components making up the encloser, one main body, the LCD screen mounting plate, the LCD screen knob, and a lid to the top of the encloser.</p> <p>Next up: electronic enclosure ventilation. Luckily enough for me, the Mini RAMBo has two 12-volt fan ports on the board, which can be turned on and off by the firmware. I used one of these ports to connect a small 40x10mm 12-volt fan to the closer, which is turned on by the firmware when the board\u2019s stepper motor drivers are activated, the default encloser fan configuration for marlin. This encloser fan pulls air in through a vent on the top left wall of the encloser\u2019s base. This intaken air circulates the encloser, where the cool air falls over the Mini RAMBo, positioned at the base of the encloser, before leaving through a side air vent positioned to the left of the Mini RAMBo. As a final touch to the electronics enclosure, I added a Pizza Pizza CNC logo to the front LCD plate, and some cool pizza icons on the enclosers sides, complementing the slanting nature of the enclosers front.</p> <p></p> <p>Upon the completion of this electronics box, I derived it into our shared Pizza Pizza CNC render, just like I did with the machine Z-carriage. After this completion, I spent some more time in the group fusion file, modeling in a nice plywood platform on which the machine and electronic enclosure rest.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"Projects/PizzaPizza/#configuring-marlin","title":"Configuring Marlin","text":"<p>The electronics system of our machine is no good without firmware, so naturally, after completing the machine\u2019s electronics design, I began the firmware compiling process. Our Pizza Pizza CNC runs a version of the Marlin 3D printer firmware on the machine\u2019s Mini RAMBo. Marlin is an open-source firmware project with a great community of makers behind it, and thus was an easy choice for our machine due to the great documentation. The variations and branches of Marlin can vary greatly, so I\u2019ve found that when working with the firmware, it\u2019s best to start with a base configured for the controller board that you can alter. I began the firmware powering our machine using firmware provided by MarlinBuilder and the MPCNC project as a reference to make alterations to. The compiling of Marlin is a time-consuming process on your first couple of times through although the code is well documented and the line-by-line comments make it easy to work through, however as you begin to become more finally with the Marlin layout, the code becomes easier to navigate and compile. Below are the Pizza Pizza CNC Marlin completion notes, noting major aspects/configurations of the firmware. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that the amount of small simple changes made in our instance of the firmware would be too many to cover on this page, despite that, the configured instance can be found under this publications Supplies section, and smaller changes than those covered on this page can be found, explain part by part by the codes comments.</p> <p>This instance of Marlin firmware is an altered version of that supplied from the MarlinBuilder repo.</p> <ul> <li>Configured for MiniRambo</li> <li>Configured for CR10_STOCKDISPLAY</li> <li>Custom Boot screen</li> <li>Custom Status screen</li> <li>Configured with 0 Extruders - for CNC use</li> <li>Custom Pizza Maker Menu</li> <li>Configured with Marlin Game Menu</li> <li>Triple Enabled Servo Control Ports</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Projects/PizzaPizza/#custom-boot-and-status-screens","title":"Custom Boot and Status Screens","text":"<p>Upon bootup of Marlin, you are greeted with a graphical boot screen and then a machine status screen on the system\u2019s LCD, a good place to make a first impression. The firmware gives you the ability to include custom boot and status screens in your firmware instance, a feature I took advantage of, setting up our Pizza Pizza CNC firmware to boot with a chef hat logo, and include a \u201cPizza Pizza - CLS Fab Lab\u201d icon on the LCD\u2019s status screen. The first step in configuring these screens is to enable the firmware to show them. This can be done simply by uncommenting the lines\u2026</p> <pre><code>// #define SHOW_BOOTSCREEN\n\n// #define SHOW_CUSTOM_BOOTSCREEN\n\n// #define CUSTOM_STATUS_SCREEN_IMAGE\n</code></pre> <p>in Marlin\u2019s <code>Configuration.h</code> file. These three lines are found towards the very top of the <code>Configuration.h</code> file, just under the firmware author credits. Once uncommented, the lines will become more vibrant when compared to the comment lines, showing their activation.</p> <p>With the custom screen options enabled, the next step was to generate and include the image files to be shown on these screens. Starting with the custom boot screen, I created a new file in my Marlin directory, under the Marlin folder named _Bootscreen.h. This file is recognized by the Marlin instance as a custom boot screen, and thus the firmware will display the contents of the text file on bootup. With this file created, the next step was to generate the content of the file, a process made simple with Marlin\u2019s Bitmap Converter. This bitmap converter tool from Marlin\u2019s website converts a bitmap image file into text content that can be pasted directly into Marlin\u2019s <code>_Bootscreen.h</code> file. Here I chose a bitmap logo for our machine, a chef hat icon with Pizza Pizza written below it, and imported the bitmap into Marlin\u2019s converter. Under the tool, I selected the Marlin 2.x check box, so the tool would generate a format for the updated version of Marlin, along with the Binary, ASCII Art, and Boot checks. The Binary check box will output the conversion in a binary format that can be inserted into the <code>_Bootscreen.h</code> file, as opposed to the generic .hex file. Next, the ASCII Art check box, adds a nice preview of the screen to the converted code, making the text a little more readable. And Finally, selecting the tools Boot checkbox will format the conversion for the <code>_Bootscreen.h</code> file. With all these checks marked, I used the tool to convert the bitmap and then copied the output into my <code>_Bootscreen.h</code> file under my Marlin directory.</p> <p></p> <p>Moving on to the firmware status screen file, the basic file setup for the screen is practically the same as the boot screen. First, I created a new file in my Marlin folder, titled _Statusscreen.h, and then used the same Bitmap Converter to convert a Pizza Pizza - CLS Fab Lab logo and Pizza icon into our systems status screen. This conversion can be done by checking all the same boxes as before, Marlin 2.x, Binary, ASCII Art, except the Boot checkbox, as now because were generating the status screen, I checked the Status box. Despite these correct settings, I would receive an error while generating this status screen, as, unlike the systems boot screen, Marlin\u2019s status screen has more space requirements. I found these two lectures on Customizing Marlin LCD and Marlin\u2019s Custom Status Screen helpful while troubleshooting this, as both videos explain the different requirements of these custom screens and the workings behind them. The Marlin status display screen leaves a 128x19 pixel canvas for a custom status screen, with even less room for any other display graphics included on the status display. Our instance of Marlin has a 105x19 pixel canvas for this custom screen, due to the animated fan icon shown on the status display when the electronics encloser fan is activated. This fan icon comes preset when a fan is set up in Marlin, and I think adds a nice touch to the status display, so I decided to leave it, and work with the 105x19 pixel canvas. Keeping this size in mind, I rescaled the logo bitmap to the correct size and touched up the image pixel by pixel until the entire thing was clean black and white. I then reimported the small bitmap into the converter, checking the boxes listed above, and converted the image before copying the output into the <code>_Statusscreen.h</code> file in my Marlin folder.</p> <p> </p>"},{"location":"Projects/PizzaPizza/#custom-interface-menu","title":"Custom Interface Menu","text":"<p>With our instance of Marlin customized with a custom boot and status screen, I next moved on to the interface\u2019s LCD menus. Due to the lack of an SD card reader on both the Mini RAMBo board and the Ender 3 LCD, I opted to enable a customer menu in Marlin where we could store our pizza-making gcode and run it through the LCD interface. Marlin can be configured with custom menus like this through its <code>Configuration_adv.h</code>. I started a new custom menu by uncommenting line 3227,</p> <pre><code>// #define CUSTOM_USER_MENUS\n</code></pre> <p>This feature enables the ability to include a custom menu to run gcode commands in the Marlin interface. I began the menu by naming it and setting some default settings with the lines \u2026</p> <pre><code>#define CUSTOM_USER_MENU_TITLE \"Pizza Maker Menu\"\n#define USER_SCRIPT_DONE \"M117 Pizza done.\"\n#define USER_SCRIPT_AUDIBLE_FEEDBACK\n#define USER_SCRIPT_RETURN\n</code></pre> <p>These lines in order first name the menu Pizza Maker Menu, tell LCD to print Pizza done. on the status screen after a script is run, enable the LCD to give audible feedback when the menu is used, and also to return the interface to the status screen when a script is run. With these settings set, I next included the two different options under the menu, with the lines \u2026</p> <pre><code>#define USER_DESC_1 \"Load Pizza Pan\"\n#define USER_GCODE_1 \"G28 X Y\"\n\n#define USER_DESC_2 \"Make A Pizza\"\n#define USER_GCODE_2 \"G28 X Y\"\n</code></pre> <p>These lines establish the two menu options, to Load Pizza Pan and to Make A Pizza, and the gcode that will be run when selected. The gcode put in place here, \u201cG28 X Y\u201d is just a place filler in the Make A Pizza slot until the actual pizza-making code is written, however, it does serve its purpose in Load Pizza Pan, as the line homes the machine on its X and Y-axis.

The toolend system of our CNC was made by my friend, Charles DeMey. The Marlin firmware can control servos natively through gcode commands when configured in the firmware, so this was my first step in the servo setup process. The servo control sections can be found at the very bottom of Marlin\u2019s <code>Configuration.h</code> file, and you can enable servo control by uncommenting the line \u2026</p> <pre><code>// #define NUM_SERVOS 3\n</code></pre> <p>The number following this line tells the firmware the number of desired servos, in m=our machines case three, two used by the tool ends, and one for possible expansion. In correspondence with this line, you will next need to set a servo delay, so each servo will have time to reach its desired angle. This delay value needs to contain an array of delay values corresponding to the number of servos set up in the prior line. In our case, this array looked like this \u2026</p> <pre><code>// #define SERVO_DELAY { 300, 300, 300 }\n</code></pre> <p>setting a delay of 300 for each of the three servos individually.</p> <p>Unfortunately, the Mini RAMBo board were using in our electronics system doesn\u2019t come equipped with on-board factory servo pins, however, this issue can be worked around by reestablishing the board\u2019s pins in marlin, assigning different servo pins. The Mini RAMBo comes equipped with 6 onboard endstop pins, for MIN and MAX dual end stopping, a feature that was not taken advantage of on our Pizza Pizza CNC, so I settled on switching the board\u2019s three MAX endstop pins, into our needed servo pins. I located the Mini RAMBo board file under my Marlin directory and scrolled through the file until I found the board\u2019s Limit Switches section. Here I switched the Mini RAMBo pins 30, 24, and 23, from the factory MAX endstop pins, into three different servo pins, <code>SERVO0_PIN</code>, <code>SERVO1_PIN</code>, and <code>SERVO2_PIN</code>.</p>"},{"location":"Projects/PizzaPizza/#game-menu","title":"Game Menu","text":"<p>As a fun little touch to our machine\u2019s instance of Marlin, I enabled Marlin\u2019s easter egg game menu on line 1427 of <code>Configuration_adv.h</code>.

This built successfully on the first try, so I next moved on to connecting the Mini RAMBo to my computer and flashing the firmware. One thing to keep in mind while flashing the firmware to a Mini RAMBo is the need to power the board from an external power supply while connected via USB to a computer. I hooked up the board to a 12-volt input from a power supply and connected the board to my computer via a USB cable.

I printed the large base to our encounter with supports to allow for the side pizza icons to come out cleanly, and thus after the print, I had to post-process the part. All parts printed for any of my systems use PETG plastic, and in my belief that allows this post-processing to be a little easier. I followed the same steps taken to clean up my prints in my Fab Academy 3D printing week assignment, and these processes can be read about on that page.</p> <p></p> <p>After this cleanup, I began to install the electronics inside the case, first screwing the LCD panel to its mounting place, using the plate\u2019s spacers, to align the screen in its opening, shown below.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>I then moved on to welding this front plate with the LCD attached to the encloser\u2019s base, sticking the two together with superglue, before using a hairdryer and some sandpaper to clean up the edge. Nextly, I installed the Mini RAMBo on its mounting pins, aligning the board\u2019s USB port with its corresponding cutout, and also screwed in the enclosure fan with some M3 screws and bolts.</p> <p>I moved on to setting up the machine wiring harnesses and altering some stepper cables for each axis. The Machines X-axis steppers are set to run off of the same port on the Mini RAMBo, so I first prepared this cable, by splicing two stepper connectors to one of the board connectors, and next reversing two of the stepper connector wires, one of the stepper cables, to ensure the two motors would be reversed, and thus move in the same direction when mounted in a mirrored position. One of these X-axis stepper cables also needed to be longer than the other, due to the mounting position of the stepper in correspondence to the electronics housing, so I added a bit of length to one of the connectors. I also repeated this added length of the Z-axis stepper, and plugged these two wires, along with the unaltered Y-axis wire into the Mini RAMBo.</p> <p></p> <p>The next wiring step was the power of the system, which simply meant connecting the Mini RAMBo to a 12v DC power supply, and that to an AC adapter and fuse box (Yes the fuse here helps, I blew one in this box while testing due to me being stupid, so the inclusion of this part saved the system). I hooked up our Mini RAMBo\u2019s power adapter to some speaker wire, and ran it to the VCC and GND outputs of our power supply, hooking up each wire to the correct output. Nextly, I attached the Ac adapter and fuse to the system, by hooking up the live, neutral, and ground wires to our power supply, before plugging in the system to test. This power wiring setup worked, and the whole system booted up, as shown in the picture below.</p> <p></p> <p>The final pieces to this wiring puzzle involved connecting the three axis\u2019s endstops to their correct MIN endstop pins on the Mini RAMBo, and also attaching some servo extender cables to the designated servo data pins, set up above in the firmware, before routing all of these cables through the enclosers back wall zip ties, mounting the cables cleanly out of the way.</p>"},{"location":"Projects/PizzaPizza/#gantry-assembly","title":"Gantry Assembly","text":"<p>The majority of the Gantry assembly process was print cleanup, due to the gantries a large amount of 3d printed parts, and like before I followed the same post-processing steps as I did in my Fab Academy 3D printing week assignment, but after all, this was complete. Below, I\u2019ll quickly touch on the assembly of each of the printed components I worked on\u2026</p> <p>starting with the belt tensioners. There were eight corners on our machine in total, but only four needed assembly/post-processing. These were the four top corners including the machine\u2019s X-axis belt tensioners. These tensioners are assembled by sliding an M3 nut into the tensioners slot, securing it in with an M3 bolt, which runs through the nut and connects to a pressure distribution end, where the belt wraps around. On any piece connecting a belt to a 3d printed component, I included meshing teeth, to align and hold the belt in place snuggly without adhesives.</p> <p></p> <p>I then used these eight printed corners, along with some 20x20 aluminum extrusion to assemble the machine\u2019s frame.

This was inserted just as you would any other brass insert, by heating the coupler with a soldering iron, aligning it to the claw\u2019s hold, and applying pressure to push the insert into the claw. From here, I used two M3 bolts and nuts to secure the brass coupler in the claw, ensuring no rotation in its resting place.</p> <p></p> <p>To complete the rest of the Z-carriage, I first, like all the other prints before it, removed supports from the print and post-processed the part.</p> <p></p> <p>The first step in this carriage assembly was the installation of the embedded couple support bearing.

I first mounted the Z-axis stepper, coupler, and threaded rod in place, ensuring the couple was sitting flush on the embedded bearing, before attaching the stepper to the carriage with some M3 screws. Nextly, I prepared the bottom half of the axis, using a mallet to hit the two steel rods into the bottom of the axis, mounting the axis claw to these rods, and screwing on the Z-axis endstop to its mount, before hitting this whole assembly onto the bottom of the Z-carriage, leaving me with the completed product shown below.</p> <p></p> <p>I then mounted the Z-carriage to the two Y-axis steel rods, and handed off the gantry assembly to Graham Smith, who attached my Z-carriage to his X-Axis carriages, and worked with me to mount the whole gantry to the frame of the machine.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"Projects/PizzaPizza/#pizza-making","title":"Pizza Making!","text":"<p>To prepare a pizza in our Pizza Pizza CNC, a .gcode script will need to be run on the machine, just like a 3d printer or other CNC machines.

To do this I first created a custom hopper \u201cbit profile\u201d in Estlcam (just a 25mm end with fast speeds and feeds), and selected this tool along with Estlcam\u2019s Hole tool from the toolbar.</p> <p></p> <p>I then exported this pocket-like circle toolpath from Estlcam via \u2026</p> <pre><code>file &gt; Save CNC Program\n</code></pre> <p>and then view the generated .gcode in Esltcam\u2019s GCODE preview window.</p> <p></p> <p>This process left me with generated gcode of a single circle, that I could later manipulate into our pizza-preparing gcode. I ran a quick test of this generated gcode on my personal CNC, just to confirm it\u2019s working, shown in the video below.</p>"},{"location":"Projects/PizzaPizza/#tool-change-servo-control","title":"Tool Change &amp; Servo Control","text":"<p>The next step in our pizza preparing gcode was flattening out servo control, and proper tool change code. I worked with Charles DeMey on this process, starting with controlling the two servos on Charles\u2019s tool ends for our CNC. This servo control feature is a feature I had set up prior in the Marlin firmware (talked about above), and Charles and I worked off of my compiled firmware to attach a data line from each servo to their set pins on the Mini RAMBo. Originally, I was planning on not only running this data line to the servos from the Mini RAMBo but also VCC and GND to power them from the board. However, this setup drew too much current to the servos and left the system\u2019s LCD unable to display characters. As a workaround to this, I ended up powering each of these servos through a Buck converter attached to our machine\u2019s power supply, stepping the 12v signal down to 5v for the servos. From here, Charles spend a little time writing and testing 5 different angles for each servo</p> <ul> <li>Closed</li> <li>Half Open</li> <li>Open</li> <li>Opposite Half Open = Opposite Closed</li> </ul> <p>and converted these 5 angles, into gcode servo control commands, inserting the servo angle into \u2026</p> <pre><code>M280 P&lt;index&gt; S&lt;pos&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>The M280 command initiates Marlins servo control, where we can then declare the servos port with the P, and set the desired angle with S. We used this format for each servo 5 angles and copied this servo control gcode into our generated circle code to use later.</p> <p>After the servo control gcode was flattened out, Charles began the work of writing tool change gcode for our CNC, writing out the rough positioning of each hopper when on its holder, jogging the machine to line up with the holder, and picking up the hopper. He wrote the tool change instructions for each hopper\u2019s pickup and return based on these positions, before having to leave for the night. Unfortunately, the next day Charles was unable to make it back to the lab due to COVID protocol, so I took over testing his work, with a little help from Graham Smith. With Charles\u2019s tool changing code as a starting place, we began altering each position value little by little until we had a completely successful automated tool change, shown in the video below.</p>"},{"location":"Projects/PizzaPizza/#compilation-of-gcode-parts","title":"Compilation of GCODE Parts","text":"<p>The final step in our machine gcode was to compile all of these individual sections together. I began in an updated smaller version of the circle file (so we could clear the machine hoppers, we couldn\u2019t use as big of a circle), where I began by copying in the servo closed command at the start of the code, ensuring no sauce and cheese leaks before called on. Next, I included the line\u2026</p> <pre><code>G28\n</code></pre> <p>which homes the machine on all 3 axes, to their corresponding endstops. From here I copied in the tool change gcode to pick up the sauce hopper, before copying in the generated smaller circle gcode. Inside this generated circle, I copied in the servo half-open line at the point when the machine reaches the center of the crust and is beginning to spiral out and also included the servo close line when the last spiral point was hit. The final piece to this first sauce code was the hopper return code, which I copied in at the very end of the generated gcode, and then included another\u2026</p> <pre><code>G28\n</code></pre> <p>to rehome the machine. I copied the entirety of this sauce code below the last line as a starting place for the cheese gcode. I replaced all sauce hopper tool changes and servo control lines, with their corresponding cheese hopper lines, and finally, the machine gcode was complete!</p> <p>Of course, after all this work on a pizza-preparing machine, the only logical test for the machine would be preparing a pizza. We set up our CNC by covering the entire work area and all parts that could be covered with a plastic trash bag, as I didn\u2019t want to get sauce on our newly working machine. From here, we loaded the two hoppers with tomato sauce and some shredded cheese, confirmed everything looked right, and then ran the final pizza preparing gcode, and\u2026</p> <p>\u2026 it worked!! The pizza preparing gcode worked through both of its tool changes, creating spirals of sauce and cheese on our pizza crust. Unfortunately, there were a couple of small issues in the run-through, one being not enough sauce put in our sauce hopper, so upon its tool docking, the hopper wasn\u2019t heavy enough to stay in the holder, and the other being a sticky cheese. We had left our cheese and sauce out in our lab for almost two days before the test, and not only did this cause the cheese to smell, but also left us with a cheese that would not stop sticking to itself, proving an issue when trying to get the cheese to fall from the hopper, however, the cheese fell through the hopper hole with a little convincing, and finally we had prepared a pizza.</p>"},{"location":"Projects/ProjectPortfolioSite/","title":"Project Portfolio Site","text":"<p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p></p> <ul> <li>01 Home</li> <li>02 Projects</li> <li>03 Writing</li> </ul>  Project Feed"},{"location":"Projects/ProjectPortfolioSite/#project-portfolio-site","title":"Project Portfolio Site","text":"Teddy Warner| Summer, 2021 |  6-7 minutes <p>The behind the scenes of the site you are on right now :)</p> <p>This site relies on MKdocs, a static site generator is written in python to create the content of the site, as well as the MKdocs Material Theme for customization.

Just before this Rx and Tx junction, a Double-Pole Double-Through switch allows for the switching of this conversion to UPDI to straightforward Rx and Tx lines, routed each to their corresponding pin. Thus, the programmer board includes a UPDI, Rx, and Tx output pin, in addition to a VCC and GND line.

It\u2019s death by innuendo.\u201d<sup>14</sup> Furthering GM Short\u2019s skepticism, Professor Kenneth Regan, widely considered to be the world\u2019s leading expert on chess cheating, took it upon himself to analyze Niemann\u2019s games and found no evidence of cheating. </p> <p>Naturally, Niemann isn\u2019t taking kindly to these slanderous accusations, and has filed a federal lawsuit accusing Carlsen of \u201cmaliciously colluding with others to defame [him] and ruin his career.\u201d<sup>1</sup> Niemann is after at least $100 Million in damages from defendants Carlsen, his company Play Magnus Group, the online platform Chess.com and its leader, Danny Rensch, as well as grandmaster Hikaru Nakamura. The court filing, found below, accuses GM Nakamura and Chess.com of bolstering Carlsen\u2019s \u201cegregious\u201d claims through their platforms.</p> <p>Niemann\u2019s counterattack hasn\u2019t ended in his pursuit of reparations, Niemann claims Carlsen couldn\u2019t handle losing to him, implying through his court filing that Carlsen\u2019s actions further support his notorious \u201cinability to cope with defeat.\u201d<sup>20</sup> The court filing states that Carlsen\u2019s actions were taken in an attempt to solidify his status as \u201cking of chess\u201d<sup>20</sup> so he could complete his company\u2019s buyout by Chess.com - a $82.9 million acquisition.<sup>21</sup> </p> <p>Niemann\u2019s victory over the world champion, \u201cshould have propelled Niemann\u2019s career to the next level and allowed him to continue realizing his enormous potential as the next great American chess player.\u201d<sup>20</sup> Yet, \u201cUnbeknownst to Niemann at the time, Defendants would do whatever it took to ensure that this would never happen.\u201d<sup>20</sup></p> <p>It\u2019s worth mentioning again that Niemann has publically admitted to cheating with aid from electronic devices in online matches, once at age 12 and again at age 16. Niemann referred to one of these instances as \u201can absolutely ridiculous mistake\u201d<sup>22</sup>, while maintaining that he had never cheated in a tournament with prize money. </p> <p>A couple of weeks after their initial accusations, Chess.com released a formal, 72-page report (found below) outlining an investigation into Niemann\u2019s play, and alleging that Niemann has likely cheated with electronic aid in more than 100 games, and as recently as 2020, including in matches where money was on the line. The magnitude of Niemann\u2019s alleged cheating scandal, as presented in Chess.com\u2019s report, proves to be much larger and longer-lasting than Niemann publically admitted. Chess.com\u2019s investigation relied on a variety of analytical tools to compare the moves of Niemann to those recommended by chess engines, and noted \u201cmany remarkable signals and unusual patterns in Hans\u2019 path as a player.\u201d<sup>13</sup> The site claims that \u201cwhile [they] don\u2019t doubt that Hans is a talented player, we note that his results are statistically extraordinary\u201d<sup>13</sup>, and their investigation into Niemann\u2019s gameplay has uncovered \u201cblatant cheating\u201d.<sup>13</sup> The report states that Niemann privately confessed to these allegations and that his Chess.com account was subsequently closed in 2020.</p> <p>In a private letter to Niemann, Chess.com\u2019s Chief Chess Officer, Danny Rechsch writes \u201cWe are prepared to present strong statistical evidence that confirms each of those cases above, as well as clear \u2018toggling\u2019 vs \u2018non-toggling\u2019 evidence, where you perform much better while toggling to a different screen during your moves\u201d.<sup>13</sup> While the report outlines that Chess.com has historically treated bans as a private matter, the ongoing accusations and Niemann\u2019s ban from the site\u2019s Global Championship spurred the platform to provide the investigation that provided justification for their decisions. </p> <p>While this evidence against Niemann appears to be overwhelming, it\u2019s important to remember that the Sinquefield Cup is an over-the-board tournament. Cheating online and over the board are two entirely separate entities, no amount of online cheating in the world provides sufficient reason to accuse Hans of over-the-board cheating, as the act itself is a different task that would require extreme preparation to achieve. Thus, in face of a lack of evidence to support over-the-board cheating allegations against Niemann, the Von Niemann Probe was born. In an attempt to further the investigation into this scandal, we developed an AVR-based Bluetooth telegraphing shoe insole to test the feasibility of creating and using an over-the-board chess cheating aid.</p> <p>Cheating in Chess</p> <p>Cheating in chess, whether online or over the board, is wrong and ruins the game for everyone. This project has been published to showcase the possibility of such a device\u2019s existence/use, and should not be recreated with the intent of using it for genuine foul play.</p> <p>Name Orgins</p> <p>The Von Niemann Probe is named after a theoretical self-replicating space probe known as the Von Neumann Probe, named after legendary 20th century Hungarian-American mathematician John Von Neumann. The Von Neumann Probe is regarded as the optimal way to explore the cosmos, as it can mine asteroids and leverage the exponential growth of its progeny to more efficiently visit star systems. And, coincidentally, probes are also medical devices that can be used to explore one\u2019s bowels. Thus, we settled on naming our device the Von Niemann Probe.</p> <p>Von Niemann Probe Repository </p>"},{"location":"Projects/VonNiemannProbe/#telegraph-design","title":"Telegraph Design","text":""},{"location":"Projects/VonNiemannProbe/#pcb-design-integration","title":"PCB Design &amp; Integration","text":"<p>At the heart of the Von Niemann Probe lies an AVR ATtiny 412-based Bluetooth telegraph.

Before starting any PCB design work in Autodesk EAGLE, I took some time to write out these expectations for the systems operating principle and then began the PCB schematic. The VNP mainboard is a barebones ATtiny 412 setup, including voltage regulation and smoothing capacitors, as well as headers for connection to a Bluetooth module, vibration motor, and battery power.</p> <p>The schematic includes headers for an HC-06, with serial connections to the ATTiny 412, and a shared power line with both the IC and Vibration Motor.

The PCB is built around the rectangular nature of the HC-06 Bluetooth module - one of these modules is placed in the center of the PCB, allowing for an as-compact-as-possible footprint ideal for fitting in the VNP\u2019s discrete insole body (see Step 2). Just above the HC-06 module lies the ATtiny 412 circuit and UPDI programming pins, as well as a cutout and mounting points for the telegraph\u2019s vibration motor.

I decided to build the brains around Stockfish, a famous chess engine that already has a functioning Python integration and also happens to be the highest-rated engine at the time of writing. For reference, the engine plays at a 4000 level, while the current highest-rated player, Magnus Carlsen, is currently sitting at about 3200.

I used Version 15 in this project. A more current version can be downloaded from stockfishchess.org or use this permanent download link of the version that I used during development.</p> <p>Next, I researched the Stockfish Python module and integrated it into a continuous loop in Python that would allow it to play games repeatedly without requiring the relaunching of the code. The module is pretty simple to instantiate, but it does feature a few optional parameters that can regulate its strength and how much hardware it occupies locally.</p> <pre><code>stockfishPath = \"C:/\u2026\" #replace with the path to your Stockfish exe. \n#Note - the path may only contain forward slashes, no backslashes.\n</code></pre> <p>I began by adding a path variable to my Python program that stores the local path of the Stockfish installation. The path can be found by navigating to the folder that stores Stockfish and finding the .exe file inside of the folder. I then placed this path into the variable, making sure to replace the backslashes that windows copies with for forward slashes. The code will not run with backslashes.</p> <pre><code>fish = Stockfish(r\"{0}\".format(stockfishPath),\ndepth=18, parameters={\"Threads\": 4, \"Hash\": 256, \"UCI_LimitStrength\": \"false\"}) #stockfish object declaration, can regulate strength\n\nprint(\"WDL Accepted \" + str(fish.does_current_engine_version_have_wdl_option()))\n</code></pre> <p>I then configured Stockfish inside of the program.

This allows us to interact with each byte one at a time and not touch the other ones until they are ready to be buzzed. This prevents the need for any local strings or storage for the moves, as each byte in a move is no longer necessary after it is buzzed once, which means that accessing these bytes just once is sufficient.</p> <p>The local char, receive, is set to each byte contained in the move, in the order that they are received. With our encoding method, each byte is either a \u201c.\u201d or a \u201c9\u201d or empty, so these are the only conditions necessary that will result in a buzz. Sometimes junk data is sent, so it is better to leave this final condition open-ended as an else statement instead of including another conditional checking for null bytes, as junk data would result in a crash in this case.</p> Telegraph Reciving<pre><code>    //(c) Teddy Warner &amp; Jack Hollingsworth - 2022\n\n    //This work may be reproduced, modified, distributed, performed, and displayed\n    //for any purpose, but must acknowledge Teddy Warner  &amp; Jack Hollingsworth.\n    //Copyright is retained and must be preserved.

printed robotic arm with \u03c0\u2080.</p> <p>The future will undoubtedly consist of robots that \u201cjust work\u201d. Where autonomous machines are informed by semantics and senses in the same way we humans are.</p> <p>In his 2022 paper, A Path Towards Autonomous Machine Intelligence Dr. Yann LeCun proposes that for ML systems to truly mimic the human ability to act in novel situations/environments, said ML systems must master both the semantic and scientific domains.<sup>1</sup> They must both understand language/society and physical/time.</p> <p>While current Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs) very accurately grasp language and society, they fall short in the later physical domains. To establish machines that \u201cjust work\u201d, we must fill in this hole: we must equip ML systems with an understanding of time and space.</p> <p>I work full-time on this very problem at Intempus, equipping agents with an understanding of time and space through the collection and analysis of physiological data. Yet that\u2019s not what this piece is about, we\u2019ll be focusing on a different approach: be focusing on generalist robotics policies.</p> <p>In early February 2025, Physical Intelligence, a company developing foundational robotic control policies, open-sourced \u03c0\u2080, a state-of-the-art Vision Language Action (VLA) model. \u03c0\u2080 excels in a number of diverse tasks (folding laundry, cleaning a table, scooping coffee beans, etc.) while remaining general enough to control a variety of robot types (single arm, dual arms, mobile robots, etc.).</p> <p>Many of you asked for code &amp; weights for \u03c0\u2080, we are happy to announce that we are releasing \u03c0\u2080 and pre-trained checkpoints in our new openpi repository!

Vision Language Action models like \u03c0\u2080 provide a generalist baseline for autonomous machines, allowing said robots to adapt and learn new tasks with minimal additional data.</p> <p>Thus robots informed by generalist policies like \u03c0\u2080 can truly assist/interact in diverse environments, leveraging semantic knowledge and visual understanding from \u2018internet-scale\u2019 pretraining, and in turn understanding and executing complex tasks much like humans do.</p> <p>\u03c0\u2080 is built on \u2018internet-scale\u2019 vision-language pretraining, giving the model an incredibly robust visual understanding and semantic knowledge. The model extends into the physical real by incorporating action and observation state tokens, enabling the model to output continuous motor commands and high frequencies (50 Hz). Physical intelligence notes that their model was initially trained on data from 8 distinct robots, and later expanded to 7 robotic platforms with 68 unique tasks.</p> <p>[PI0 robots photo]</p> <p>The open-source release of \u03c0\u2080 is still considered an experiment: \u201c\u03c0\u2080 was developed for [Physical Intellegence\u2019s] own robots \u2026 and though [they] are optimistic that researchers and practitioners will be able to run creative new experiments by adapting \u03c0\u2080 to their own platforms, [they] do not expect every such attempt to be successful. All this is to say: \u03c0\u2080 may or may not work for you, but you are welcome to try it and see\u201d!<sup>2</sup></p> <p>So Physical Intelligence has gifted us with this very cool model which happens to work with many expensive robots. The folks at \ud83e\udd17 Hugging Face open-sourced a PyToarch port of \u03c0\u2080 concurrently with Physical Intelligence\u2019s release, and it felt only right to get \u03c0\u2080 up and running on a cheap and sturdy robotic arm: the $160 LeRobot So-100!</p>"},{"location":"Projects/pi0/#setup-your-environment","title":"Setup Your Environment","text":"<p>LeRebot is an awesome subsidiary of Hugging Face which provides open-source models, datasets, and tools for robotics - all written with PyToarch.

Eswaran acknowledges that he was fortunate in life, having \u201cevery innocent source of joy the world offered\u201d, yet despite this seeming success, he was left always looking for more, a greater sense of meaning <sup>26</sup>. </p> <p>One of the driving forces existing behind my assignment of meaning in my life has been my emotions. When I consider the value or meaning of something, I ask if this thing makes me happy if I derive joy from this thing, and by doing so have found that my life experience has been net-happy, and rather joyful.</p> <p>Like Easwaran, my personal philosophy has granted me lots of sources of joy offered by the world, and I\u2019m quite content with this established mindset. Yet, it\u2019s not difficult to look past this facade of joy with the question, does this really matter? While I am often able to answer this question with a simple \u201cyes, as it makes me happy\u201d, I sometimes wonder why my happiness matters in the first place. </p> <p>Like Easwaran, I\u2019ve found an answer to this in these Hindu (and Buddhist) traditions. The Hindu sage\u2019s justification for human actions with the phrase \u201cjust for the heaven of it\u201d seems to give more credit to my \u201cyes, as it makes me happy\u201d response than I have given myself. My happiness matters because I exist and because I exist, anything that makes me happy enough to assign meaning to also matters. The aspect of both Hinduism and Buddhism that I appreciate is that there\u2019s not much more to it than that, existence is meaning. Thich Nhat Hanh acknowledges that to exist \u201cis a wonder\u201d, to \u201cbe alive\u201d, \u201cbreathe in\u201d, and \u201cmake one step\u201d is meaningful, valuable, and \u201calready wonderful enough\u201d <sup>27</sup>. The simple, \u201c innocent\u201d sources of joy matter because both they exist, and I exist <sup>28</sup>.</p> <p>While I was initially content with deriving meaning from existence, I found continuing our dive into eastern philosophies to only further rid me of skepticism, specifically how do we know we (and everything else) truly exists? How can we be sure that we arewere not in a simulation? </p> <p>Questions like these have never proved to cause me any existential dread, as my mindset has always paralleled that of Havelock Ellis seen in his quote \u201cDreams are real as long as they last. Can we say more of life?\u201d. I\u2019ve set aside the potential of reality not being real as insignificant as regardless of its truth, the experiences I\u2019ve experienced must be real, because I\u2019ve experienced them. </p> <p>While my disregard for this potential fallacy of existence has allowed me to preserve my sanity, Thich Nhat Hanh\u2019s presentation of the concept of Interbeing as a tool to aid in our understanding of the Heart Sutra, also seemingly defines existence in a way that it itself must exist. The single most important given that Hanh outlines as existence is found in his quote \u201cbecause you are there, I can be here\u201d, without the existence of other things, we ourselves would not exist \u201cnothing can be by itself alone\u201d <sup>29</sup>. We can be sure both we and everything exists because \u201cwe are inextricably interrelated\u201d, our nature is a product of everything else, and everything else is a product of us <sup>30</sup>. I\u2019ve found through Hanh\u2019s analysis of the Heart Sutra that meaning is derived from existence, and existence only exists because of interbeing. </p> <p>If meaning in life is a product of our existence, and our existence only exists because of the existence of everything else, it follows that the meaning of our life stems from the existence of everything else.</p> <p>Naturally, the same logic may be followed for the individual existence of everything, where your existence provides the meaning for someone else\u2019s life. This concept takes the personal agency I appreciated so much before my introduction to Hinduism and Buddhism and expands it massively. The world not only impacts me, but I impact it; I\u2019ve been granted the agency to not only assign meaning and value in my life, but provide meaning for others through these assignments. </p> <p>Hanh uses this concept to justify morality and desire for personal happiness saying \u201cTo smile is not to smile only for yourself; the world will change because of your smile\u201d <sup>31</sup>. I found this mutual importance of everything providing and receiving meaning for/from everything else a reflection of the \u2018We\u2019 culture held by many Hindu/Buddhist practicing communities, and this new level of understanding of life\u2019s meaning has not deterred my individuality, but instead caused me to embrace the rest of the world in the same way as I would myself.</p> <p>I\u2019ve found myself to be more appreciative of others and conscious of my surroundings after my introduction to Hindu and Buddhist texts. Not only have I kept my individual agency to assign value and meaning to the things in life which bring me joy, but these texts have filled the void left by Nietzsche with an inherent meaning. They\u2019ve equipped me with understand how others impact me, and how I impact them, as well as how without others, there would be nothing. </p> <p>Most importantly the understanding I\u2019ve gained over meaning and value in our reality has catalyzed my ability to create the conditions in life where what I desire may occur.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Hanh, Thich Nhat. \u201cThe Other Shore\u201d.

We\u2019re not asking \u201cwhat traits do I think are benevolent?\u201d but \u201cwhat traits have consistently enabled human thriving?\u201d  </p> <p>John Stuart Mill attempts to define voters fit for democracy in Considerations on Representative Government: \u201cActive, self-helping character types promote progress better than passive ones.\u201d<sup>5</sup> There are two ways forward with this constraint 1) We refine the voter base to only the most active, self-helping voters, or 2) We educate more potential voters into more active, self-helping citizens. </p> <ul> <li> <p>Option 1 is in practice the current American structure, given the majority of active voters are elderly and focused on existential aid for their own benefit (think Social Security and Medicaid, which are certainly important topics but should not dominate the political sphere to the extent that they do). Voters with the greatest interest in self-help often hold antiquated interests that strip attention from our societal drive towards freedom and progress.</p> </li> <li> <p>Option 2 is wonderful in spirit, but pragmatically most of the US voter base is extremely passive (or inactive all together) despite substantial efforts at education of the population. Only 2 in 3 eligible voters exercise their vote, and the other third of the country lives as though we are essentially under a tyranny (with allegiance to one of two political parties).<sup>11</sup> Very few people are \u201cactive\u201d in self-help, much less the help of all society. Mill noted himself that representative government doesn\u2019t work with extremely passive populations accustomed to tyranny.</p> </li> </ul> <p>The \u201cactive\u201d and \u201cself-helping\u201d character types become much stronger when we start to de-bias the voter base from antiquated and malicious interests with the objective, benevolent traits our longest-lasting practices have held and valued for so long.</p> <p>So can freedom and democracy exist alongside each other? Certainly! We\u2019ve been running a trial by fire of this experiment for 250 years now. Yet a true popular democracy cannot indefinitely maintain freedom. At best, it is an inefficient means to make adequate progress toward the continuous goal of freedom, and at worst, it empowers malicious actors who hinder our pursuit.</p> <p>The question before us is not whether all humans deserve their natural liberties - they do, universally. Rather, it is whether all humans are equally positioned to protect those rights through voting. If we want to continue our Western pursuit of freedom and natural liberties, we would find it best to be prudent with our voter pool: careful not to empower malice, yet instead promote benevolence.</p>"},{"location":"writings/benevolentfreedom/#postscript","title":"Postscript","text":"<p>I wrote the first draft of this piece while sitting in a courtyard of Gyeongbokgung Palace in Seoul. I (like many others) find it very easy to critique America from oversees, somewhat removed from the confines of our great experiment. Since returning to the states and publishing this piece I\u2019ve had quite a few wonderful conversations that have meaningfully shifted my thinking. As I admitted in my exchange with Aidan in the comments, I\u2019m now perhaps 2/3 confident in my original analysis - down from where I started. I thought I could outmaneuver the Meno, but no avail on this front lol (yet).</p> <p>That said, I remain convinced there\u2019s notable tension between unconstrained democracy and individual freedom. What I\u2019m less convinced of is that further constraining the voter pool is the right resolution. A more compelling alternative emerged from conversations with Aditya: rather than constraining who can vote, we should constrain what people can vote on, a neo-federalism of sorts.</p> <p>The core insight is that voter incompetence becomes dangerous when it can\u2019t be tested against reality. By directing political attention toward what is most personal - the local and state level - incentives align between voter and representative, and greatly reduce barrier to be an informed participant. The voter has to vote well because the stakes are higher and more visible, and the representative has to honor the voter to avoid being tarred and feathered (literally or metaphorically). This addresses both voter incompetence and representative incompetence structurally, without requiring us to define and enforce \u201cvirtue\u201d at the ballot box.</p> <p>This approach is more defensible, more aligned with American tradition, and more implementable than my original proposal. It sidesteps the virtue trap entirely while still addressing the efficiency concerns I raised. The question shifts from \u201cwho is benevolent enough to vote?\u201d to \u201cwhat scope of governance allows feedback loops to punish bad policy regardless of who votes?\u201d</p> <p>Peter Thiel, in a recent interview, offered an interesting inversion of my original thesis:</p> <p>\u201cIt would be healthy if we had elections in which fewer people voted. I think the turnout was pretty high in New York. I think it would be healthier if people didn\u2019t care, if it didn\u2019t matter who was mayor, and people just didn\u2019t vote.\u201d</p> <p>This suggests the goal isn\u2019t more virtuous voters, but less consequential federal elections - which aligns more closely with the neo-federalist framework than my original proposal. If local governance mattered more and federal governance mattered less, low turnout wouldn\u2019t be a crisis but a feature.</p> <p>The American experiment may have succeeded not because the founders perfectly constrained the voter pool, but because they perfectly constrained what any government - regardless of who voted - could do to individual liberty.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Thiel, Peter. \u201cThe Education of a Libertarian.\u201d Cato Unbound, April 13, 2009. https://www.cato-unbound.org/2009/04/13/peter-thiel/education-libertarian/\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>\u201cWho Voted in Early America?\u201d Colonial Williamsburg Foundation.

That\u2019s the prior to novel hardware work, the justification for the stupendous time/energy/and capital into it; the resulting tech must be exponentially better than the prior most comparable thing. Unlike software where it\u2019s possible to stack marginal improvements, the \u201csquare wave\u201d of time/energy/cost of hardware demands this massive upside.</p> <p>Yet the repercussive nature of such a substantial upside often hinders the propagation of that novel hardware itself. Say I have a robot arm that I\u2019ve developed to pack boxes in an amazon factory. This particular robot arm can do the work of 5 men in a single day. Great! Stupendous even! Very easy to justify the cost of said arm, as opposed to the salaries of 5 men. So why doesn\u2019t every factory deploy thousands of arms and save a ton of money?</p> <p>When those robots fail (and they do, though somewhat infrequently) you now lose the productive output of 5 men. Very rarely (when employing humans) do such a large multiple call in sick, or quit, or have some sudden downtime. Yet when deploying robots with such a substantial upside multiple, we seem to do so despite our downside protection not yet following.</p> <p>Consider a robot arm at $70K that replaces 5 warehouse workers at $35K/year each ($175K in annual labor). Let\u2019s say this robot works at ~10x human speed, so it can accomplish in one hour what takes a human ten hours. Looks like a 5 month payback period, right? Now assume the robot fails just 1.5% of the time, that\u2019s 131 hours per year. During those 131 hours, you don\u2019t just lose one worker\u2019s output. You lose the productive capacity of that 10x speed multiplier doing the work of 5 people. That\u2019s 131 hours of zero output where you expected 5 worker equivalent productivity at 10x speed, or roughly 6,550 man-hours lost annually. At $35K per worker/year (~$17/hour), that\u2019s $111K in lost productivity. This gets even worse when you consider that this robot must be removed from the production line for debugging (further reducing productive output), and debugged by a costly roboticist (increasing expenses). The 5 month payback stretches to 18-24 months, and that\u2019s if the factory can even stomach the productivity volatility.</p> <p>This fail state is everything. It keeps the market size and CAGR small by minimizing the number of people who can see a true ROI with that new technology. This has very little to do with the cost of debugging. This has everything to do with the loss of productivity.</p> <p>This pattern doesn\u2019t apply universally. Novel hardware that has achieved massive scale historically solved adequately protected their downsides or avoided it entirely. Smartphones replaced telegraphs and landlines, but the downside of a dead smartphone is just reverting to baseline: you can\u2019t make a call for a few hours. As such, smartphones had lower absolute downside risk despite being more complex. Similarly, EVs replace combustion vehicles but with comparable failure modes. When a Tesla fails, you\u2019re down one car, same as a combustion vehicle failure. The productivity multiplier is 1:1, so the failure multiplier is also 1:1. Industrial robots are different. A warehouse robot arm that replaces 5 workers creates a 5:1 productivity multiplier, but also a 5:1 downside multiplier. This is the core asymmetry that limits industrial robot adoption despite obvious ROI.</p> <p>Hardware founders and engineers consistently underweight tail risk in adoption decisions. The compounding economic impact of correlated failures is the primary hindrance in expansion of hardware efforts. If more engineers considered this, propagation of novel hardware in the physical world would compound much faster.</p> <p>The market prices hardware startups like SaaS companies, favoring sleek launch videos and niche early adopter markets. This works for software because SaaS companies can build $100M ARR businesses selling to 500 companies in a tight, self-reinforcing ecosystem. Hardware can\u2019t play this game. The market is the physical world itself, and mass adoption is limited by downside tolerance, not upside potential.</p>"},{"location":"writings/efd/","title":"The Emotion/Feeling Discontinuity","text":"<p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p></p> <ul> <li>01 Home</li> <li>02 Projects</li> <li>03 Writing</li> </ul>  Writing Feed"},{"location":"writings/efd/#the-emotionfeeling-discontinuity","title":"The Emotion/Feeling Discontinuity","text":"Teddy Warner| Dec 2024 |  5-6 mins <p>Emotions can be defined as \u201cguesses\u201d about the future.

Although O\u2019Brien is a fictional character first conceived when Orwell published 1984 in 1949, this dialogue has been constructed as such where O\u2019Brien has been placed in Socrates\u2019 reality, and each man holds a chronically correct conception of events up to ~400 B.C.E. The dialogue begins with a private conversation between Socrates and O\u2019Brien somewhere in classical Athens after the two had exchanged formalities.</p> <p>O\u2019BRIEN. Socrates, whom do you believe is the true beneficiary of justice? Justice presents itself in a way that one would believe is most advantageous to the exploited, as it offers a form of protection from those in power, yet I refuse to believe it would exist in our society if it were negative to those who control society altogether.</p> <p>SOCRATES. O\u2019Brien, I\u2019d argue that justice is no more advantageous to the people being exploited than it is to those in power.</p> <p>O\u2019BRIEN. Socrates, it cannot be true that justice provides no advantage to anyone. You are aware that some people\u2014many even\u2014believe justice to be a virtue.</p> <p>SOCRATES. Yes, I\u2019m aware of this.</p> <p>O\u2019BRIEN. And if these people perceive justice to be virtuous, then it follows that justice must provide some benefit to said people to make them believe so.</p> <p>SOCRATES. Not necessarily, O\u2019Brien.</p> <p>O\u2019BRIEN. Well then, if justice is neither beneficial to the people in power, nor to those exploited by them, to whom is it beneficial?</p> <p>SOCRATES. To find this, O\u2019Brien, we must expand our categorization of society beyond one group of exploiters and another of exploited.</p> <p>O\u2019BRIEN. How so, Socrates? If some people in society are exploited, then it must follow that there are exploiters of those people.</p> <p>SOCRATES. Yet exploitation is not equal among the exploited. There then must exist some middle which could be split from our prior exploited group\u2014those who are in control of enough power to not be outright exploited, but also do not wield enough to hold it absolute. Thus we may say three groups exist: a high, the power-wielding; a middle, those in pursuit of the power held by the high; and a low, who are exploited by the prior two in both their pursuit and maintenance of power.</p> <p>O\u2019BRIEN. Do you mean to imply that these middle people are the ones to whom justice is advantageous?</p> <p>SOCRATES. Yes, as justice enables the existence of this middle in a society. When perceptions of justice control legislation, exploitation is dampened enough for those who have enough power to exploit others, yet not enough to secure absolute power, to act on their ability to exploit others. Without justice, this distinction drawn between the middle and the low could not exist.</p> <p>O\u2019BRIEN. To this point, I follow, Socrates, yet I do not understand why justice would not be equally beneficial to the low, as well as a tool to be utilized by the high.</p> <p>SOCRATES. That cannot be the case, O\u2019Brien, as the benefits of justice only outweigh its consequences in the case of the middle. Justice hinders the ability of the high and limits their power, and while it may provide protection to the low, justice is not sufficient to provide a means by which the low may gain power. Justice, in its most advantageous form, serves as a tool in the pursuit of power for those who do not already have it absolute, yet are in control of enough of it to not be outright exploited\u2014those who are in \u201cthe middle.\u201d Tell me, O\u2019Brien, would you agree that the aspirations of a ruling class, those who currently wield the power, must be to maintain and expand their power by any possible means?</p> <p>O\u2019BRIEN. That must be the case, yes.</p> <p>SOCRATES. So then, O\u2019Brien, justice must not be beneficial to the high, as it inhibits their maintenance and exertion of power. If we agree that power is central to the aspirations of the high, would it not follow that the middle would share in this pursuit?</p> <p>O\u2019BRIEN. That is a reasonable expectation, Socrates. Something tells me you are getting ready to outline that the goals of the low also follow this pursuit of power.</p> <p>SOCRATES. Not quite, O\u2019Brien. In a society where justice is promoted, the low may be protected from much of the potential exploitation of the higher two classes, yet never wield any power themselves. Ignorant of the luxuries of power, the low must only hope for a just society in which they become equal to the middle and high.</p> <p>O\u2019BRIEN. So then, if the low have goals aligned with justice and are in pursuit of the virtuous equality it, in its purest form, will provide, would the low not be the class to which justice is most beneficial, with the middle and high instead deriving their success from power?</p> <p>SOCRATES. In a society where justice was integrated in its purest form, you would be correct, O\u2019Brien. The middle and high would lose all power to exploit the low, and thus a society would exist where all men are equal. Yet in a pragmatic sense, a society like this could not come about, not due to a lack of understanding of justice and ethics, but instead due to our acknowledged aspirations of both the middle and high.</p> <p>O\u2019BRIEN. Why is that?</p> <p>SOCRATES. In a hierarchical, semi-just society, as we\u2019ve laid out in our discussion of the low, middle, and high, the power of any two classes would presumably be sufficient to exploit the third. With members of society pursuing or maintaining the finite power that society has to offer, any attempt to establish a system of pure justice would be corrupted by the middle attempting to use the low as a means of acquiring power, and would be outright rejected by the high, who naturally will do anything in their power to maintain the power they wield. The only class which may truly achieve their aspirations in such a society is the middle, who hold the power to manipulate justice to enlist the help of the low, revolt against the high, and seize power for themselves, before promptly slinging the low back down into their exploited position.</p> <p>O\u2019BRIEN. I see now, Socrates, that justice is most beneficial to the middle, and not at all to the low, providing a delusional hope which enables a never-ending cycle of exploitation by the middle and high in their pursuit of power. Yet still I do not believe it to be undesirable by the high.</p> <p>SOCRATES. Do you mean to suggest that you believe the high would like to lose their power, O\u2019Brien?</p> <p>O\u2019BRIEN. Not at all. You would agree if it is said that a cycle of power transfer as you\u2019ve described would only be possible with the ignorance of the low, right Socrates?</p> <p>SOCRATES. That must be true if the middle is continually able to manipulate the low for their own aspirations.</p> <p>O\u2019BRIEN. Then this ignorance of the low must not only enable the potential for exploitation by the middle, but also the hierarchical structure of society itself. Irrational hope for equality by the low is the belief that leads to the low\u2019s psychological acceptance of exploitation from those in power in the first place. These hopes may be manipulated by both the middle and the upper to direct blame for the plight inflicted on the low to some scapegoat, furthering the ignorance of the low. If those in power paint said scapegoats to be unjust and negative to society, then the low will accept exploitation as a means to enable their societies to thrive. The low will become willing to suffer, and their hopes of justice then justify the tyranny of the high. Thus, Socrates, justice must be beneficial for both those who are in power and those who are in pursuit of it, as it provides a means for the acquisition of power\u2014the trading of power between the prior \u201chigh\u201d and the prior \u201cmiddle\u201d\u2014as well as a justification for the exploitation of the low by the high once in power.</p> <p>SOCRATES. Then it can be said that any man who wields power, whether the high, with absolute power, or the middle, with enough to exploit the low, is benefited by justice. Although on the surface it seems to hinder their power, justice actually provides the means by which they can acquire and justify their power in the first place.</p>"},{"location":"writings/immortalitytrap/","title":"The Immortality Trap","text":"<p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p></p> <ul> <li>01 Home</li> <li>02 Projects</li> <li>03 Writing</li> </ul>  Writing Feed"},{"location":"writings/immortalitytrap/#the-immortality-trap","title":"The Immortality Trap","text":"Teddy Warner| Dec 2025 |  12\u201315 mins <p>This morning a friend sent me an intresting read: The Decline of Deviance an aggregate of data showing a massive collapse in risk-taking behavior over the past few decade. Teen alcohol use down 50%. Sexual activity down 40%. Fighting down 35%. Geographic mobility collapsed from 20% of Americans moving annually to 10%. Even our aesthetics became safer, British Museums analyzed photos of their artifacts over time and found a steady shift toward black, gray, and white, away from bold colors. Seemingly, we\u2019ve entered an \u201cepidemic of the mundane\u201d.<sup>8</sup></p> <p> </p> Changes in the color of objects over time <p>At the time of writing this piece, I\u2019m 20 years old. According to the Social Security Administration, my average life expectancy is 81.6, meaning I have roughly 61 years left on this planet.<sup>1</sup></p> <p>Every time I get in a car to go somewhere, I run about a 1 in 8.3 million chance of death.<sup>2</sup> Every time I sit down to eat, about a 1 in 147 million chance of choking.<sup>3</sup> Every walk I take, roughly 1 in 5.5 million.<sup>4</sup> Every time I take up a simple convience, I wager the remaining 61 years of my life for said convience (i.e. I\u2019m essentially wagering 61 years at 1:8.3M odds every time I drive).</p> <p>Let\u2019s conceive of a world of pragmatic \u2018immortality\u2019, one where the average lifespan is 1000 years. Our wager of years of life in exchange for convience still occurs, except in this world I\u2019d be wagering 980 years for those same conveniences. The stakes increase 16 fold while the benefits remain near identical!</p> <p>To state this precisely: the average drive is about 10 miles, that\u2019s currently about 4 minutes of expected life loss per trip. With a 1000-year lifespan, that same trip costs 62 minutes of expected life. The wager is 15.8x larger.<sup>5</sup></p> <p>So what happens if we achieve our sought after \u2018immortality\u2019? Say we cure aging, dampen disease, and successfully extend the human lifespan to ~1000 years. The transhumanist dream.</p> <p>I conjecture our lives would be no better than they are now.</p> <p>But Teddy! Surely, by the time we have 1000-year lifespans, we\u2019ll have much safer technology. And you would be right to claim this, the fatal risk associated with any given acction will continus to decline!</p> <p>Between 1900 and 2024, life expectancy jumped 68%, from 47 to 79 years.<sup>6</sup> During the same period, transportation got dramatically safer and faster. Traffic deaths dropped from ~18 per 100 million miles in the 1920s to 1.20 today, a 15x improvement.<sup>7</sup> Average speeds increased from 8 mph (stagecoach) to 45 mph (cars), roughly 5.6x faster.</p> <p> </p> Life expectancy vs transportation speed 1900-2024 <p>For most of the last century, technological safety and speed massively outpaced our lifespan. Risk per trip decreased 110x while stakes only increased 1.3x. Subjectively, travel got safer despite having more years of life at risk.</p> <p>Yet, unfortunately, this trend tapered off towards the end of the 20th century. Since 1970, transportation speeds have stagnated or declined. The Boeing 747 (1970) cruised at ~600 mph. The Boeing 787 (2024)? only ~560 mph. We had supersonic passenger flight with the Concorde at 1,350 mph - we abandoned it in 2003. US highway speeds have been stuck at 55-75 mph for fifty years. Meanwhile, mean life expectancy kept climbing, with about a 12% increase (from 70.8 to 79.2 years).</p> <p>I find the Concorde\u2019s retirement to reveal something profound: people with longer lives value safety over speed. They\u2019d rather fly 7 hours at 560 mph than 3.5 hours at 1,350 mph if the crash rate is marginally higher. With 1000-year lifespans and those same risk ratios, would anyone fly at all?</p> <p>Or look at playgrounds - I grew up playing in this massive wooden playground in the Chicago suburbs, with a somewhat ever-present risk of injury.<sup>12</sup> Today, it is illegal to build a sandbox in a playground in San Francisco.<sup>13</sup> As our life expectancy rises, it makes more sense to optimize toys and playgrounds for preventing lawsuits rather than developing children who know how to manage risk.</p> <p>Our modest (~12%) lifespan increase since the end of the last century has already caused massive behavioral changes. The value of statistical life has jumped from $2.5M in 1982 to $12.5M in 2023 (inflation-adjusted).<sup>9</sup> That\u2019s a 5x increase in what society would \u2018pay\u2019 to prevent one death, while GDP per capita only grew 2.5x (so clearly wealth alone isn\u2019t our driving motivator).</p> <p> </p> Value of statistical life 1982-2023 <p>If we try extrapolating this out over even the next 500 years, we can assume a near-complete eridication of risk. Not necessary because people are conscious of this, but rather because the expected value of any convience shifts dramatically. If people\u2019s base state is one of higher comfort, they have substantially more time to do things, and doing any rapid convienent thing is wasting this additional time, of course, society becomes sluggish!</p> <p>This derisking problem compounds even further when we consider that risk aversion grows with age. How much longer will a parent \u201cbaby\u201d their child in a society of 1000-year lifespans? The age of those setting the behavioral norms will continously shift higher and hider, and society will become more and more risk adverse. In a society with 1000 year lifespans, the median person (presumably the cohort of people setting behavioral precidant) would be 500 years old. If risk adversion continues growing with age at the rate observed in current populations (roughly 1.5% per year of age), a 500 year old would be about 8.5x more risk-averse than the average 20 year old today.<sup>10</sup> 92% of the population would be more risk-averse than today\u2019s 80-year-olds. Can you imagine what a pathologically conservative culture we would regress into? That all \u201cyoung\u201d people would inherit and thus compound?</p> <p> </p> Risk aversion vs age projected over 500 years <p>This growing risk aversion with age likely already incorporates diminishing marginal utility of additional years - when you have fewer years left, each one is more precious. This only intensifies with radical life extension, making the compounding risk aversion even more severe.</p> <p>Consider what drives progress in human society: coordinated overinvestment in \u2018uncertain\u2019 outcomes. Our tolerance for risk is everything if our fight against stagnation. Transhumanists want radical life extension, technological acceleration, and human flourishing (which in principle I find lovely), yet this dream contains a fatal contradiction: pursuing the first destroys the second, which destroys the third. More years of existence doesn\u2019t mean more accomplished. It might mean less.</p> <p>I believe the alternative is quite obvious: rather than drastically extending our lifespan, extend cognative peak within roughly normal lifespans. Extending cognitive peak to age 80 within a 100-year lifespan produces about 52 productive years of output, or 0.52 output per year of life. Extending lifespan to 1000 years with cognitive peak to age 300 produces 152 productive years, sounds better, but that\u2019s only 0.15 output per year. The former is 3.5x more efficient at generating human value.</p> <p> </p> Cognitive extension vs radical life extension <p>There\u2019s something quite poetic about this. The obsession with living longer, our quintessential measure of medical progress, may actually hinder us in the long run. Every time I walk to my office, I\u2019m making a bet. With 61 years left, I\u2019ll take that bet. With 980, I\u2019m not so sure. And when enough people stop taking enough bets, civilization stagnates.</p> <p>The goal shouldn\u2019t be more years, it should be more productive years. Quality over quantity if you will. </p> <p>All my projections extend wayyyy beyond biological plausibility - we have emperical data to age ~85 and extrapolating to 500-1000 years require assumptions that may not hold.

My dad converted to Catholicism when I was young, and faith was always present in our household. I attended Catholic school in my youth - though this was partly practical (Catholic schools in Chicago let you start kindergarten a year early, perfect for my working professional parents).</p> <p>The Catholic education system in Chicago was wonderful\u2014full of smart people looking to thoughtfully engage with their faith. I never questioned my faith in my childhood. It was what I knew, and I embraced it fully, serving as an altar boy for several years.</p> <p>In 2016, my family moved to North Carolina for my dad\u2019s work. I was just starting middle school.</p> <p>My mom wanted to keep my siblings and me in Catholic school, so I started sixth grade at a large Catholic middle school. I found my new school dismally easy and started coasting. More troubling, I hadn\u2019t found the same thoughtful engagement with faith; instead, I found what I would call \u201cculturally Catholic\u201d (we go to church, we do the things, because this is what we are told to do).</p> <p>Maybe it was this new Catholic culture, or maybe just my entry into the teenage years, but I started to question a lot.</p> <p>For a while, I acted as though I were too \u201ccool\u201d for Catholicism. While I kept up my practice - attended weekly mass, got confirmed - I also stopped singing, started picking flaws with any homily I could, and sought logical inconsistencies in the church with a fine-tooth comb. My practices had fallen to the level of \u201ccultural Catholicism,\u201d while all my thoughtful engagement turned to \u201cdebunking\u201d the faith I was brought up in.</p> <p>Fortunately, I\u2019m certainly not the first Catholic to experience this.</p> <p>I changed schools in eighth grade, transferring to a secular private school that was much more intellectually engaging. I started research and writing, eventually finding all my free time outside school (and sometimes when I really should have been studying) taken up by whatever my latest project was. I finally had a proper outlet for \u201cthoughtful engagement,\u201d though my participation and attitude towards faith had been quite tarnished.</p> <p>Outside of my projects, I became fascinated by philosophy, and eventually, found myself in a philosophy class my senior year of high school. I held the Classics in high reverence, alongside my contemporary favorites: Niezche and Dostoevsky. Yet when we took on Catholic philosophy and even secular attempts at \u201cproving\u201d the faith (ahem \u2026 Descartes), I took up my old search for logical inconsistencies (with a much greater rigor than any other era/domain we covered in the class). </p> <p>One of the quams of attending a secular school is that this appears to be the norm. The brightest young, often left-leaning, high school minds want to rebel against institution and prove their intellectual prowess, and there is no target more apt than the Catholic church. I fell into this bucket of students, desperately wanting to free myself from any intellectual \u201cprerequisites\u201d that had been \u201cthrust\u201d upon me, and with no one willing to take the other side, I ruthlessly kept picking for logical inconsistencies. </p> <p>I ended my high school career with a focus on Eastern philosophy. Thich Nhat Hanh\u2019s The Other Shore was a particular favorite of mine (see: A Mutual Meaning), as I found it provided a sense of peace and resolution to many outstanding questions: What matters? What am I to do with my life? (both of which felt particarly pressing as I ended my time in high school - see: On Turning Twenty) I\u2019ve always had a laissez-faire nature, and rarely get too worked up about decisions, and found this eastern philosophy to be a really nice confirmation that this is, in fact, a sane way to live.</p> <p>I think it was through my acceptance of this eastern philosophy (initially through an entirely secular lens) that I finally allowed my faith to slowly creep back into my life. </p> <p>I moved to California after high school and had a brief stint at university before moving to the Bay Area to work and research full-time. As I lived and grew on the cutting edge, I began to realize how woefully naive I had been.</p> <p>When I first experienced \u201ccultural Catholicism,\u201d my ego rose to a place where I felt all the knowledge I\u2019d amassed was somehow too substantial, too worthy, to bother thoughtfully engaging with Faith any longer. As it turns out, we know extraordinarily little about the world and our reality. The atheist argument falls apart when you consider the scientific vanguard! There\u2019s so much we don\u2019t know, and more notably, so much where logic and science fall short.</p> <p>Take, for instance, what happened before the Big Bang? Or what lies beyond the observable universe? How does subjective experience arise from neural computation? What determines the boundary between conscious and non-conscious systems? What determines emergent behaviors and phase transitions? What is the relationship between mathematical objects and physical reality? How do we handle infinite regressions in causal explanations? </p> <p>The list goes on.</p> <p>The first gulp from the glass of natural sciences will turn you into an atheist, but at the bottom of the glass God is waiting for you.</p> <p>\u2013 Werner Heisenberg</p> <p>When I sat down to record a video for my application to the Thiel Fellowship in late January this year, I read this quote from one of my favorite German physicists. I think it\u2019s the most eloquent summary of my adolescent Catholic experience.</p> <p>One may place themselves, their intellect, in higher regard than faith as a whole (this is quite easy to justify when you have no one to thoughtfully engage your faith with!), and this will drive you mad. Man simply doesn\u2019t know the world well enough to justify or debunk the faith, and as such, we cannot view this as a logical problem (nor a tool for bright high school students to prove their intellectual independence).</p> <p>Rather, we must simply believe.</p> <p>John 20:24-29</p> <p>24 Now Thomas, called the Twin, one of the twelve, was not with them when Jesus came. 25 The other disciples therefore said to him, \u201cWe have seen the Lord.\u201d</p> <p>So he said to them, \u201cUnless I see in His hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and put my hand into His side, I will not believe.\u201d</p> <p>26 And after eight days His disciples were again inside, and Thomas with them. Jesus came, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said, \u201cPeace to you!\u201d 27 Then He said to Thomas, \u201cReach your finger here, and look at My hands; and reach your hand here, and put it into My side. Do not be unbelieving, but believing.\u201d</p> <p>28 And Thomas answered and said to Him, \u201cMy Lord and my God!\u201d</p> <p>29 Jesus said to him, \u201cThomas, because you have seen Me, you have believed. Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed.\u201d</p>"},{"location":"writings/on-becoming-a-godfather/#no-mans-land","title":"No Man\u2019s Land","text":"<p>I propose one may think of the dynamics of faith and science as a trenched battlefield from the top down (this is more of a visual metaphor, not meant to imply a necessary conflict between faith and science).

The space between them - a no man\u2019s land of sorts - remains particularly interesting. It is this no man\u2019s land that becomes an origin of doubt for many. If there\u2019s a true unknown, one not understood through faith nor science, it seems natural for the human mind to imagine how we could discover and justify that thing rationally (which is, in fact, the essence of science).</p> <p>Yet even if we could successfully discover and justify every unknown within this no man\u2019s land, there would still be the trench of faith. This is because, as discussed earlier, there\u2019s a line at which science and secular logic fall short (most notably on the vanguard).

Kind of crazy (or at least feels more substantial than the past few years).</p> <p>Three years ago, I had a long think about what I wanted to do with myself, with my future. I was sitting in my high school\u2019s woodshop after school and had a few hours to kill while watching a CNC machine hum. I loved engineering (and still do). Yet, I couldn\u2019t help but feel as I progressed nearer and nearer to university, the parts of engineering I loved most (tangible building, making, experimenting) would fade away in favor of a more meticulous, tedious commitment to theory.</p> <p>Whatever I was to do in the future would probably need to stray from the bliss of publishing my passions to favor a more pragmatic output, and in turn, I would be losing the very thing that I was finally starting to gain recognition for.</p> <p>This certainly felt like a dilemma. Everyone I knew, and I always associated myself with engineering, and unsurprisingly, I aspired to continue my pursuit in the field at university. That being said, I\u2019ve never been one for dismal work and dreaded the idea of physics class after physics class with less and less opportunity to build and experiment.</p> <p>I wasn\u2019t quite sure where I\u2019d end up or what I\u2019d be doing, but this uncertainty never really bothered me much. In fact, for a few months, I thought I might become a YouTuber (and even made a banger video for one of my projects: We Built the Alleged Hans Niemann Chess Cheating Device) as it felt like a good means of financially justifying my continued work on my projects.</p> <p>It was around this time in my life that one of my old friends/coworkers told me about this program he was in at USC: the Iovine and Young Academy. This program was pretty epic, and it looked to address my dilemma exceedingly well: the academy spans engineering, business, and design - a great balance for the aspiring maker. I applied, got in, and moved to California. It was awesome.</p> <p>I loved university, I loved the classes, I loved the people. I met some of my closest friends, worked on my first venture, and then at eighteen landed an early position on the Midjourney hardware team. A few months later, I found myself at a crossroads: I loved my work at Midjourney and got to work alongside the most incredible people, yet I had just turned nineteen and felt compelled to spend my next few years doing work of my own. Ultimately, I decided to return to USC.</p> <p>Yet after much reflection, I found university an exceedingly high-risk place to be. High risk that I wouldn\u2019t leave a profound impact on the world, as the crux of university involves learning/doing the same thing as everyone else. Any means of \u201cdifferentiating\u201d myself while in university (clubs/grades/projects/etc) are trivial compared to the differentiation possible by doing something else altogether.</p> <p>Around last Christmas, I floated my theory for Intempus and what I had been up to to my parents for the first time in a cafe in Washington, DC, and again floated the potential of dropping out. Somehow, this time that statement felt much more serious than the prior two. My mom told me something along the lines of \u201cyou keep telling me you want to drop out and then backing out. It\u2019s going to keep digging at you unless you give it a shot.\u201d</p> <p>So, three days into my fourth semester in college, I rented a U-Haul, packed up all my stuff, and moved to San Francisco to work on Intempus full-time. I had gone from not quite knowing what I wanted to do with myself, to finding a program which somehow solved my dilemma, to leaving that program altogether. I stand by this being one of my all time best decisions and took a considerable amount of mental back and forth, and several late night walks before I built up the courage to pull the trigger (I think talking with my Mom ultimately gave me the final boost of courage needed for this which I couldn\u2019t appreciate more. Thanks Mom, I love you!).</p> <p>For a while, I lived without accolade, sleeping in my buddy\u2019s kitchen a few feet from my desk. Nine months after starting Intempus and five months after dropping out, I received the Thiel Fellowship, a fellowship for young people who want to build new things instead of sitting in a classroom.</p> <p>I now run Intempus full-time, and get to profoundly impact the world at my own discretion.</p> <p>I don\u2019t think I could dream of a more wonderful position.</p>"},{"location":"writings/on-turning-twenty/#wonderful-blur","title":"Wonderful Blur","text":"<p>My final few teenage years have been an absolute blur of wonderful things.

Here are some of the things that stuck.</p> Carpe Diem <p>The moment the first chime of your alarm rings through the air in the morning, stand up! Plant your feet on the ground, get up. Make your bed, brush your teeth, seize the day. Suck the marrow out of life, you\u2019ll feel the difference.</p> Causa Sui <p>According to Google, \u201cCausa sui\u201d is a Latin term meaning \u201ccause of itself\u201d or \u201cself-caused.\u201d It refers to something that is generated within itself, and is a concept explored in philosophy, particularly by Spinoza, and in psychology by Freud and Becker. In these contexts, it often relates to the idea of a being or entity that is not dependent on any external cause for its existence or nature.</p> <p>According to Teddy, \u201cCausa sui\u201d is man\u2019s most important mantra. Intrinsic motivation is everything and is the cause of passion and genius. It is by far the most important trait to foster. Just pursue the things you find interesting. You\u2019ll thrive! Extrinsic motivation never allows for true creativity - let your internal compass guide you, and you\u2019ll do impactful things. </p> <p>That said, I\u2019ve found that surrounding yourself with excellence is one of the easiest/most important ways to increase your excellence. Excellent people provide an excellent bar for you to hold your interensic aspirations.</p> Spontianety <p>Spontaneous should be fostered (to the highest extent that it can be). Hands down, the best things I\u2019ve had the pleasure of experiencing are a product of spontaneity. You just need to remain open and active.</p> Confidence is key <p>You\u2019re in a perpetual rivalry between what you imagine you can do and what you can achieve. </p> <p>Why not imagine the best possible version of yourself? As I wrote in The Emotion/Feeling Discontinuity:</p> <p>To foster confidence, one may take advantage of the Emotion/Feeling Discontinuity. Emotions precede decision-making. Humans feel first and think second. Given emotions are objective physiological responses, the independent variable in confidence, the \u2018weight\u2019 for you to adjust, is your interpretation of emotion: your feelings.</p> <p>By adjusting your interpretations of emotions, largely through changing your self-talk, you may rapidly build your confidence and comfort with discomfort.</p> <p>A tangible example of this: the emotional (physiological) response your body exhibits during feelings of both excitement and anxiety is practically identical (a \u2018drop\u2019 in the position of your stomach, etc.). As Dr. Glenn Fox, a neuroscientist at USC, puts it, by simply slamming your fists on the table and exclaiming \u201cI\u2019m Excited!\u201d, regardless of how silly it sounds, you\u2019ll begin to morph your feelings of anxiety into excitement.</p> <p>Self-talk is everything in expanding confidence. Do not tolerate negative self-talk. Actively scold doubt and anxiety.</p> Wonder <p>Many people would be much happier/ more content if they allowed themselves to wonder about the world. Also, go on walks and look up at the trees. I\u2019ve found this to be quite the wonder-inducing inspiration point.</p>"},{"location":"writings/on-turning-twenty/#advice","title":"Advice?","text":"<p>It\u2019s very important to me that as I progress into the next decade of my life, I do everything in my power to become the best version of myself.

Plato\u2019s text, The Meno, recounts a conversation between Socrates and Meno, initially exploring the teachability of virtue, before branching into definition of the attribute itself. </p> <p>Though The Meno concludes with an unsatisfactory crutch on the gods to \u2018explain\u2019 virtue and its origin, the recollection of \u2018inherent\u2019 knowledge produced by logical conversation throughout the text demonstrates the learning process. The bravery required to recollect your inherent knowledge lies in one\u2019s ability to realize their na\u00efvet\u00e9 on a topic and in their commitment to endure the numbness of the learning process. </p> <p>Socrates asserts a paralleled superiority to both \u201ccorrect opinion\u201d and \u201cknowledge\u201d concluding his conversation with Meno, providing a logical contrast to potential incorrect opinion or perceived knowledge <sup>1</sup>. It is this perceived knowledge &amp; incorrect opinion that shrouds one in na\u00efvet\u00e9 and hinders their willingness and/or ability to learn.</p> <p>Meno branches his conversation from the teachability of virtue to his attempt to explain virtue to Socrates, a topic he has made \u201cmany speeches\u201d about before \u201clarge audiences on a thousand occasions\u201d <sup>2</sup>. He applies societal ideals to his perception of virtue in his explanation, offering that men should be \u201cable to manage public affairs\u201d whilst \u201cbenefit[ing] friends\u201d and \u201charm[ing] his enemies\u201d, while women must preserve the \u201chome\u201d and its \u201cpossessions\u201d whilst remaining \u201csubmissive to her husband\u201d, and continues the trend for idealistic virtues held by the contemporary society <sup>3</sup>. </p> <p>Despite Meno\u2019s seeming grasp on the concept of virtue, Socrates\u2019 logical line of questioning cleaves away at his shroud of false, perceived knowledge until Meno is left \u201cquite perplexed\u201d <sup>4</sup>. It is this perplexity, or the \u2018numbness\u2019 as Socrates refers to, that is the result of the departure from the comfort of perceived knowledge and na\u00efvet\u00e9, yet also the brave first step to learning.</p> <p>In the case of learning, bravery not only is held by those willing (or thrust) into their \u2018first step\u2019, but required from those who choose to endure their numbness. </p> <p>Socrates\u2019 careful description of this numb state in his metaphor of the torpedo fish successfully emphasizes the lack of \u201charm\u201d despite the potential discomfort this state of \u201cperplex[ity]\u201d yields <sup>5</sup>. In the face of the torpedo fish, of the un-answered, unknown knowledge, bravery is to face the state of \u201cperplexity\u201d and strive for the knowledge one \u201cd[oes] not know\u201d <sup>6</sup>. </p> <p>Facing perplexed numbness is a natural transition from perceived knowledge to knowledge, and thus you do one no disposition by following the trail of logic and \u201cmaking [them] perplexed and numb as the torpedo fish does\u201d, while simultaneously exposing oneself as the potential subject of perplexed numbness <sup>5</sup>. </p> <p>Logic must be the torpedo fish, and the numbness induced by it the result of departure from na\u00efvet\u00e9 and potential false knowledge due to questioning and reason. To step beyond one\u2019s na\u00efve shroud in an attempt to recollect \u2018inherent\u2019 knowledge is the bravery of learning.</p> <p>Not only does The Meno depict the process of learning in its text, but the act of undertaking a complex classic in the contemporary day embodies the brave aspirations for the recollection of knowledge as well. </p> <ol> <li> <p>Plato, et al.
