Death is an infinite abstraction.

Experience grows proportionally to life span. Every second, every day, every year provides more content for us to abstract upon.

Death is, by definition, the end of our living experience, and as such, as we approach death, our ability to experience it approaches \(0\). Inversely, however, our capacity to abstract approaches \(\infty\).

In this, our experience before birth and after death MUST be different, as before birth we do not hold any lived experience to abstract upon.

Before birth: potential for experience is \(\infty\), while capacity to abstract is \(0\).

After death: potential for experience is \(0\), while capacity to abstract is \(\infty\).

This supports the Western projection of linear time:

\[
\text{Birth} \xrightarrow[\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\text{Time}\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad]{} \text{Death}
\]

Where experience accumulates unidirectionally, and abstraction capacity grows monotonically with time, and not the eastern view of a cyclical timeline, as we do not enter this life with the ability to abstract.

*We must experience first.*
