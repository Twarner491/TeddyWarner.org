I moved into a new apartment a few months ago. It's got a pretty bangin' kitchen.

I've always loved cooking. I'm roughly two-thirds certain that the dexterity developed in the kitchen catalyzes hardware development and vice versa (most of the best machinists I've met are great cooks). So, seemingly working on your chef skills is a productive means of improving your work (if in the kitchen) and, additionally, you get some tasty rewards for doing so, win-win!

Whether people admit it or not, I'm certain everyone has some objective downtime (no matter how brief) throughout their day. Presumably, people spend this on their phones? or through some unproductive leisure (see [Learning to Juggle](https://teddywarner.org/writings/juggling/))? I actually feel somewhat naive about what people do all day. Regardless, there's some downtime, and one of the most delightful ways to spend these brief segments of leisure is cooking! 

By pivoting into kitchen tasks with your downtime, you can take on some pretty in-depth meals, namely because you can afford to prep "all day". I wake up in the mornings and often prep for dinner a bit. Get back from the office and prep a bit more. Get back from the gym and Boom! It takes me all of 15 minutes to finish cooking. Pretty awesome.

People seem to performatically hark on how they "don't have time to cook" or convince themselves their unable to fit it in the day. If all these 996 twitter warriors spent half the time they did tweeting in the kitchen, San Francisco would be 100x better fed. Don't let these preformative preachers guilt you into ordering DoorDash, nine times out of ten, cooking yourself is one of the most productive pastimes you can hold. You're going to have some downtime, everyone does - don't waste it on doomscrolling, cook!

### Scrapbook

Since moving into my new place, I've been documenting every meal I've cooked in a scrapbook I keep on my fridge:

<div id="flipbook-viewer"></div>

<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/pdf.js/3.11.174/pdf.min.js"></script>

### Recipes

I'm usually quite a bit of a proponent of "vibes-based" cooking. No need to follow a recipie to a tee or preplan meals. 90% of the time I just start throwing some stuff together and a meal pops out (I find this substantkially reduces the mental overhead of cooking and saves me some greif in my prep work). That being said, I've certainly collected some great recipes over the years. Here are some of my favorites:

Even if I don't want to fully commit to a recipe, I find skimming over this block of favorites almost always provides some nice inspiration.
