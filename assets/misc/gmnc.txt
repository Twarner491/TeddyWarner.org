Style Greek Mac & Cheese (Serves 4)
Ingredients:
Pasta:
• 8 oz (about 2 cups dry) elbow macaroni or shell pasta
• ½ cup heavy cream (for reheating pasta)
Cheese Sauce:
• 2 tbsp unsalted butter
• 2 tbsp all-purpose flour
• 2 cups whole milk (warm)
• 1 cup shredded sharp white cheddar
• ½ cup shredded Romano cheese (plus extra for topping)
• ¼ tsp salt
• ⅛ tsp ground black pepper
• ⅛ tsp ground nutmeg
• ¼ tsp smoked paprika
Enrichment:
• ½ cup plain Greek yogurt (full-fat preferred)
Breadcrumb Topping:
• ½ cup panko breadcrumbs
• 1 tbsp olive oil or melted butter
• 2 tbsp finely grated Romano cheese
• 1 tbsp chopped fresh parsley (or ½ tsp dried)

Step-by-Step Instructions:
1. Cook the Pasta
Bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Cook pasta until just al dente. Drain and set aside.

2. Make the Breadcrumb Topping
• In a small pan over medium heat, toast the breadcrumbs in olive oil or butter until golden brown (2–3 minutes).
• Stir in Romano cheese and parsley. Remove from heat and set aside.

3. Prepare the Cheese Sauce
• In a saucepan over medium heat, melt butter. Whisk in flour and cook for 1 minute to form a roux.
• Gradually whisk in warm milk, stirring constantly until the sauce thickens (3–5 minutes).
• Lower the heat and stir in cheddar and Romano cheese until melted.
• Season with salt, black pepper, nutmeg, and smoked paprika.

4. Combine Pasta with Sauce
• In a separate pan, heat heavy cream gently and stir in the cooked pasta to rewarm it.
• Pour in the cheese sauce and mix thoroughly until everything is creamy and well-coated.

5. Finish with Greek Yogurt
• Off heat, fold in the Greek yogurt. This adds a tangy depth and smooth finish. Taste and adjust seasoning.

6. Serve & Top
• Spoon mac & cheese into bowls or plates.
• Generously top with the toasted breadcrumb mixture.
• Optionally, dollop a small spoon of Greek yogurt on top for presentation and extra tang.
